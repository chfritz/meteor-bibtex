	abstract = {We observed unexpected resonant response in [{Fe/Cr](10)} multilayers epitaxially grown on {MgO(100)} substrates which exists only when both ac current and dc magnetic field are simultaneously applied. The magnitude of the resonances is determined by the multilayer magnetization proving their intrinsic character. The reduction of interface epitaxy leads to nonlinear dependence of the magnitude of resonances on the alternating current density. We speculate that the existence of the interface transition zone could facilitate the subatomic vibrations in thin metallic films and multilayers grown on bulk insulating substrates.},

In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions with magnetite electrodes and a {MgO} insulating barrier should behave like an ideal magnetic switch, because of the half-metallic character of Fe({3)O(4)} and because of the negligible lattice mismatch between these two oxides. We have calculated the electronic structure of the Fe({3)O(4)/MgO(100)} interface and we show that the density of states is modified at this interface. We report in particular on the possible existence of a majority spin interface state which could play an important role in the magnetotransport properties of Fe({3)O(4)/MgO/Fe(3)O(4)} magnetic tunnel junctions.},

	abstract = {Magnetite (Fe({3)O(4))} is a magnetic material with potentially interesting properties for applications in spintronics. The promising properties of this oxide are unfortunately affected by several kinds of structural defects which locally modify the electronic structure. We have calculated the density of states in the vicinity of the important defects which are the antiphase boundaries. The calculations have been performed with the {LSDA+U} approximation. This approximation is suitable to study transition metal oxides with important correlation effects between 3d electrons, as we have first shown for perfect bulk magnetite, by comparing the density of states calculated with the {LSDA}, {LSDA+U}, and {PBE0} approximations. Our calculations show that antiphase boundaries are responsible for the existence of new localised electron states (defect states) which modify the electric properties, the energy gaps and the Fe magnetic moments.},

Single crystal of L-histidinium dihydrogen phosphate-phosphoric acid has been subjected to X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The title compound crystallises in the non-centrosymmetric space group P2(1). Raman spectra have been recorded in the frequency range 1150-3350 cm(-1)]. To obtain a more reliable assignment of the Raman and {IR} spectra. we have calculated the geometry and the frequencies using {HF} and {DFT} methods. All the experimental vibrational bands have been discussed and assigned to normal mode or to combinations and overtones on the basis of our calculations. The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by using {HF} and {DFT} ({B3LYP} and {BLYP)} are in well agreement with the experimental data. The results of {DFT-B3LYP} method have shown better fit to experimental ones than {HF} in evaluating vibrational frequencies. To investigate microscopic second order non-linear optical behaviour of the examined complex, the electric dipole mu, the polarizability alpha and the hyperpolarizability beta were computed using {DFr//B3LYP/6-31} G(d) method.

Our approach relies on driving preferential heterogeneous nucleation and growth of spinel cubic iron oxide ({IO)} domains onto brookite {TiO2} nanorods (b-{TiO2)} with tailored geometric parameters, by means of time-programmed delivery of organometallic precursors into a suitable {TiO2-loaded} surfactant environment. The b-{TiO2} seeds exhibit size-dependent accessibility towards {IO} under diffusion-controlled growth regime, which allows attainment of {HNCs} individually made of a single b-{TiO2} section functionalized with either one or multiple nearly spherical {IO} domains. In spite of the dissimilarity of the respective crystal-phases, the two materials share large interfacial junctions without significant lattice strain being induced across the heterostructures.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present our studies on the growth kinetics of Ge crystals on silicon oxide by nanoscale seed induced lateral epitaxy. We propose a simple and reliable method based on standard local oxidation of silicon technique for creating nanoscale silicon seeds at the edge of thermally grown silicon oxide stripes of desired thickness. The growth of Ge from germane is initiated in the two silicon seed lines and evolves toward a complete wetting of the {SiO2} stripe after coalescence. The wetting mechanism of {SiO2} by Ge is strongly dependent on the seed orientation and closely related to the development of \{111\} facets. The coalescence of adjacent Ge crystals results in an improvement in the organization of the initial material. As a result, no defect is visible in the inner part of the structure. The observed defects are arrays of misfit dislocations standing along the seed lines, while only few dislocations are visible through the Ge crystal. Geometric phase analysis of high resolution transmission electron microscopy images and x-ray diffraction reciprocal space maps show that the so-grown Ge crystal stripes on {SiO2} layer are fully relaxed, homogeneous, and fully coherent along their length. The main deviation regarding a perfect epitaxial relation with the silicon substrate is a tilt of +/- 0.60 degrees around the longitudinal axis of stripe crystals.

This anomalous oxidation that takes place at room temperature is mainly due to humidity penetration in damaged layers. Different solutions are investigated here in order to avoid this oxidation process and stabilize the Si-phase. Finally, unexpected structures as {HfO(2)} {NCs} embedded with {SiO(2)} matrix are obtained and show interesting memory characteristics. Interestingly, a large memory window of 1.18 V has been achieved at relatively low sweeping voltage of +/- 6 V for these samples, indicating their utility for low operating voltage memory device.},

Calculations of the exciton binding energy based on a variational method indicate that the dielectric confinement effect is enhanced by the low value of the organic barrier dielectric constant. Moreover, it is shown that the temperature variation of the photoluminescence peak energy is well described by Varshni's model, thus indicating the free character of the two-dimensional excitons. The temperature dependence of the photoluminescence line width is also analyzed and interpreted in terms of homogeneous broadening due to exciton-phonons interaction.},

We perform a 1 {keV} Si implantation with doses of 5×1015 Si+/cm2, 7.5×1015 Si+/cm2 and 1×1016 Si+/cm2 in a 7 nm thick silicon oxide layer through stencil mask apertures ranging from 1μm up to 5 μm. After the mask removal the samples are furnace annealed at a temperature of {1050°C} for 90 min under N2 atmosphere. The samples are then characterized by mapping the implanted and non-implanted areas by atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The intensity and the wavelength of the {PL} peak are found to depend on the implanted {NCs} cell size. A slight blue shift from 730 nm up to 720 nm is observed with decreasing cell size. Simultaneously, the {PL} intensity decreases and the signal vanishes for submicron features (which should contain 102 to 103 {NCs).} {AFM} microcopy performed on the implanted regions shows that the well-known oxide swelling usually observed after {NCs} synthesis decreases from 3.5 nm down to 0 as the cell size decreases. This result demonstrates that the effective implanted dose clearly decreases with the size of the cells. This effect is probably due to an electrostatic charging of the {Si3N4} membrane despite the metallization treatments applied to the mask surface.},

In order to unravel the very rich magnetization reversal processes, conventional susceptibility and magnetization measurements have been combined with element-selective X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism analysis. The superlattice with thin individual thicknesses ([ 1nm {DyFe2/4} nm {YFe2]} (70)) reverses as a unique giant ferrimagnetic block in which the exchange-favoured antiparallel arrangement between net magnetizations is maintained under a magnetic field. In the superlattices with large individual thicknesses ([ 10 nm {DyFe2/13} nm {YFe2]} (18) and [ 10 nm {DyFe2/20} nm {YFe2]} (13)), the expected exchange spring behaviour is observed: the soft {YFe2} layers reverse for positive bias fields, followed by the irreversible switch of the hard {DyFe2} layers.

At present, very little is known about the electrical interactions between nanomaterials and cells. We aimed to verify whether {MWCNT} electrical properties could affect the so called "charge-sensitive" cell parameters, interacting with cellular electrical activity. Human macrophages were challenged with two fully characterised {MWCNT} samples, one tested as-prepared ({MWCNT)}, the other one purified (by annealing at 2400 degrees C) and better electro-conductive (a-{MWCNT).} Our findings show that a-{MWCNTs} are less cytotoxic but possess a higher inflammatory potential, as compared to {MWCNTs.} Moreover, only annealed and better conductive {MWCNTs} affect significantly the mitochondrial membrane polarity, the intracellular {pH} and the reorganisation of cytoskeleton actin filaments, cell functions strictly dependent on electro-chemical mechanisms. Based on our results, there is evidence for electro-chemical interactions taking place between cell membranes and electro-conductive {MWCNTs.} Such a specific behaviour could have wide-range applications in the biomedical field, not only concerning those cellular systems (neuronal and bone cells) sensitive to electrical stimuli, but also other cell systems.

The fit of zero field cooled and field cooled susceptibility measurements and magnetization curves using Curie-Weiss law and a weighted sum of Langevin functions, respectively, allows the estimation of the average granule size for the films with t {\textless} 0.61 nm. The results of the estimations correlate with the data obtained from {TEM} images. Reduction of saturation magnetization for Fe nanoparticles and an increase of the coercivity up to 1200 Oe at low temperatures were found. It is attributed to the formation of Fe-{core/FeO(x)-shell} structured nanocrystals. The oxide shell gives rise to a strong contribution of surface anisotropy. Isotropic tunneling magnetoresistance up to similar to 3\% at room temperature and in magnetic field up to 18 {kOe} was found for the film with t=0.61 nm. For higher t, an anisotropic magnetoresistance typical for continuous ferromagnetic films was observed.},

Among these, the energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism has already proven its efficiency and needs improvements to be widely used. The energy spectrum imaging technique can be used to measure dichroism but some image treatments are necessary due to distortions. This paper deals with the corrections that need to be applied on the data to remove all distortions, especially drift and non-isochromaticity, and extract reliable information. The measure and correction procedures are developed on an artificial data cube containing the dichroic signal and some noise to prove the efficiency of the routines.

This cyclic deposition/etching process has been experimented at 600 degrees C with a methylsilane/(methylsilane+trisilane+hydrogen) mass flow ratio ({SiCH6} {MFR)} equal to 2.8 x 10(-4) used for {Si0.99C0.01} film deposition.

We should note that the poly-crystalline Si1-{yCy} layers are etched more rapidly than the monocrystalline layers. The etching rate ratio between poly and mono areas induces the capability, by cyclic process, to remove the deposited poly-crystalline Si1-{yCy} layers on the dielectric areas ({STI} spacers) selectively versus the recessed mono-crystalline Si1-{yCy} layers.

	abstract = {We have grown various thickness Ge layers on nominal and 6 degrees off Si(0 0 1) substrates using a low-temperature/high-temperature strategy followed by thermal cycling. A combination of 'mounds' and a perpendicular cross-hatch were obtained on nominal surfaces. On 6 degrees off surfaces, three sets of lines were obtained on top of the 'mounds': one along the {\textless} 1 1 0 {\textgreater} direction perpendicular to the misorientation direction and the other two at similar to 4.5 degrees on each side of the {\textless} 1 1 0 {\textgreater} direction parallel to the misorientation direction. The surface root mean square roughness was less than 1 nm for 2.5 mu m thick nominal and 6 degrees off Ge layers. Those slightly tensily strained Ge layers (R similar to 104\%) were characterized by 5 x 10(7) cm(-2) (as-grown layers) -10(7) cm(-2) (annealed layers) threading dislocation densities, independently of the substrate orientation. We have then described the 550 degrees C/650 degrees C process used to passivate nominal Ge(0 0 1) surfaces with Si prior to gate stack deposition. An similar to 5 angstrom thick {SiGe} interfacial layer is self-limitedly grown at 550 degrees C and then thickened at 650 degrees C (5 angstrom min(-1)) thanks to {SiH(2)Cl(2)} at 20 Torr. Such a Ge surface passivation yields state-of-the-art p-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors provided that 15 angstrom Si layer thickness is not exceeded. For higher thickness, elastic strain relaxation (through the formation of numerous {2D} islands) occurs, followed by plastic relaxation (for a 35 angstrom thick Si layer).},

In the wartime and early post-war years, the first proposals for correcting C-s were made and in 1947, in a second milestone paper, Scherzer listed these and other ways of correcting lenses; soon after, Dennis Gabor invented holography for the same purpose. These approaches will be briefly summarized and the work that led to the successful implementation of quadupole-octopole and sextupole correctors in the 1990s will be analysed. In conclusion, the elegant role of image algebra in describing image formation and processing and, above all, in developing new methods will be mentioned.},

We show that the critical damage energy density model, widely used in silicon under this or different names, can also be used in germanium to predict the existence, position, and extension of amorphous layers resulting from the implantation of ions for almost all mass/energy/dose combinations reported here and in literature. In germanium, the crystalline to amorphous phase transition occurs through the accumulation of damage (point defects and/or clusters), and this damage linearly increases with the dose (the damage is additive) until a certain threshold is reached above which the material turns amorphous. However, for light ions such as boron amorphization occurs, at room temperature, closer to the surface than expected. This demonstrates that the interstitials and vacancies generated by such implants are not stable at room temperature and that defect annihilation occurs within dilute cascades until stable complexes are formed, probably di-interstitials and divacancies.

	abstract = {We investigate the acousto-plasmonic dynamics of metallic nano-objects by means of resonant Raman scattering and time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption. We observe an unexpectedly strong acoustic vibration band in the Raman scattering of silver nanocolumns, usually not found in isolated nano-objects. The frequency and the polarization of this unexpected Raman band allow us to assign it to breathing-like acoustic vibration modes. On the basis of full electromagnetic near-field calculations coupled to the elasticity theory, we introduce a new concept of "acousto-plasmonic hot spots" which arise here because of the indented shape of the nanocolumns. These hot spots combine both highly localized surface plasmons and strong shape deformation by the acoustic vibrations at specific sites of the nano-objects. We show that the coupling between breathing-like acoustic vibrations and surface plasmons at the "acousto-plasmonic hot spots" is strongly enhanced, turning almost silent vibration modes into efficient Raman scatterers.},

	abstract = {This paper is a part of a comprehensive study aiming to understand the relationships between the conditions of the electric arc plasma process applied to the single walled carbon nanotubes ({SWCNTs)} synthesis and the features of the resulting carbon products. The parameters for this work were the type of hybridization (either sp(2) (graphite) or sp(3) (diamond)) and the grain size of the carbon source (the anode). The physical properties of the plasma were determined by in situ optical emission spectroscopy. Atomic neutral nickel Ni I and carbon {CI} lines at 349.3 nm and 909.4 nm, respectively, were selected to quantify the radial concentration distribution of these species in the plasma. The Swan band C(2)(0,0) at 516.5 nm was used to determine the radial temperature and the C(2) column density distributions at the centre of the plasma. Carbon materials formed were analysed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. A significant improvement of both yield and purity of the {SWCNTs} formed was found when the way the anode was prepared corresponded to the highest apparent density of the packed powder. This improvement was correlated with reproducible plasma characteristics, typically an axial temperature in the range 5500-6500 K, a temperature gradient lower than 2800 K mm(-1) and a high carbon concentration (similar to 10(25) m(-3)) associated with a {CI/Ni} I concentration ratio higher than 10(8). However, anodes prepared in such a way that their apparent density was lower-which corresponds to standard conditions commonly used for the regular electric arc production of {SWCNTs-consistently} resulted in the formation of the usual heterogeneous carbon product, including tubular and non-tubular nano-morphologies. These results were correlated with fluctuating, non-reproducible plasma characteristics, typically a high axial temperature ({\textgreater}7000 K), a rapid cooling within the first 0.5 mm away from the discharge axis ({\textgreater}3000 K) and a low carbon concentration ({\textless}10(21) m(-3)). The relationships between the synthesis conditions, the resulting plasma features, and the characteristics of the carbon products obtained are finally fully explained, the results from the literature are understood, and the conditions of the plasma for the optimization of the {SWCNT} synthesis are revealed.},

In most cases, the particles were smaller than 10 nm and interestingly, the sizes ranging between 10 and 100 nm have been poorly investigated until now. This is mainly due to the fact that usual chemical routes produce 5-10 nm oxide or metallic particles or eventually 20 nm at most. on the over side, atomization techniques yield particles in the micrometer range. Metallic particles are particularly interesting for better magnetic properties compared to oxides, but they have two big drawbacks: they are not biocompatible and they are conducting electricity. Consequently, it's necessary to produce core-shell particles, for which the shell is biocompatible and insulating and with a perfect control of thickness and uniformity of that shell. In this work, we are studying metallic particles synthesized by an original evaporation-condensation technique that produces particles of several tens of nanometers. We prepared hard magnetic cobalt particles and soft {FeNi} ones coated with a silica shell using a modified sol-gel method. Morphological and magnetic properties are presented, showing the efficiency of ultrasonic sol-gel process for that purpose. (C) 2008 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The colour of the slip can in fact be partially explained by the microstructure (crystalline phases, grain sizes) and the physico-chemistry (composition) of the ceramics. However, the precise process and the diffusion of this technique are still not fully known. In particular, we do not know yet how the production of sigillata took place in the south of Gaul, and the role that was played by the production under Italian influence (pre-sigillata) preceding the first local sigillata. In this work, a combination of transmission electron microscopy ({TEM)} and X-ray synchrotron diffraction techniques was used to study the microstructure of pre-sigillata slips from the main southern Gaul workshop (La Graufesenque), in order to compare their characteristics with those of high-quality sigillata. These first results seem to indicate that the antique potters chose clays adapted to their firing conditions and to the type of coating that they wanted to make. These productions cannot be described as an initial phase for the later sigillata production and, rather, seem to correspond to the intention of developing a specific type of pottery only inspired by the famous Italian sigillata forms.},

The advantages of the two main {FIB} milling techniques (H-bar and Lift-out) are discussed in detail and illustrated through the study of metallic lustre decorations and a particular type of Roman Terra Sigillata coating. The H-bar technique is ideal for investigations where the features of interest are near the edges of a ceramic fragment. A significantly large area of surface decoration can be studied without any restriction on the size and the shape of fragment. On the other hand, the Lift-out technique is very powerful for extracting {TEM} membranes far from the edges. An added advantage of this technique is that the thickness of the foil is very uniform and that allows large tilts and makes it possible to obtain electron diffraction patterns of several zones axes from the same crystal, making crystallographic phase identification easier and precise, and identification of complex structures possible. We also show that the {FIB} system can be used to deposit very precise registration marks, allowing an experimenter to correlate results from {TEM} measurements with other complementary techniques, such as synchrotron based microdiffraction and mu {XANES.} Combination of these complementary techniques is becoming a very powerful approach to probe the chemical and morphological microstructure of heterogeneous and complex material from the nanometre to millimetre scale.

	abstract = {Metallic lustre decorations of glazed ceramics, which appeared in Mesopotamia during the 9(th) century {AD}, can be considered nowadays as an historical example of controlled nanotechnology for optical devices. Their surprising optical properties are directly due to metallic nanoparticles that Islamic potters were able to bury in the first layers of glaze through empirical chemical means. Lustre technology is fascinating and many papers have been devoted to this subject. Many lustre samples have been investigated with the most modem equipment such as the synchrotron radiation, electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy and other spectroscopic methods. This decor made in the twelfth century during the Fatimid dynasty shows a quasi-perfect double layer of nanoparticles confirming the high technological mastery of this civilization. Moreover, up to now, no lustre has been found with an organization of nanoparticles as elaborate as the decor presented here.},

Fullerenes bind weakly to the external nanocone wall with similar to 2.9 angstrom spacing (0.5-0.9 {eV} binding energy), showing no discernable trend with cone tip angle. Fullerene binding inside cones is significantly stronger ({\textgreater}3 {eV)}, primarily due to strong dispersion force interactions, with higher (similar to 3.1 angstrom) fullerene-nanohorn spacing. In this case, the binding energy increases with number of pentagons in the tip. In all cases the fullerenes will be freely rotating below liquid nitrogen temperatures. For pristine cones and fullerenes, the fullerenes will experience a driving force towards (away) from the nanohorn tip when inside (outside) the nanohorn.},

Our study covers the temperature range from 440 to 750 degrees C, and we were able to efficiently simulate the dopant profiles within that temperature range, taking into account a quadratic dependence of the P diffusion coefficient on the free electron concentration. To achieve that we have taken into account dopant activation dependence on temperature as well as dopant pile-up near the surface and dopant loss owing to outdiffusion during the annealing. A combined laser thermal treatment above the melting threshold prior to conventional annealing allowed the elimination of the implantation damage, so we could perceive the influence of defects on both transient dopant diffusion and outdiffusion.

	abstract = {Organic semiconductors are very promising materials in the field of spintronic devices like spin valves ({SV)} because of large spin relaxation time in pi-conjugated molecules and the advantage of rather simple and low energy consuming device fabrication techniques. Most of the studies of spin injection in organic semiconductors focused on hole transport materials and one electron transport material: the tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq(3)). In this article, we present our first results on {SV} based on a perylene derivative, {PTCTE} ({PTCTE:} tetraethyl perylene 3, 4, 9, 10-tetracarboxylate). Perylene molecules were traditionally used as electron transport materials in optoelectronic devices like {OLED} (organic electroluminescent diodes) and solar cells. {NiFe/PTCTE/Co} devices were prepared by dc sputtering for the electrodes (with direct or off axis sample configuration for the upper electrode), and vacuum sublimation for the organic layer. {CPP} (current perpendicular to plane) devices geometry was obtained with millimetric contact masks determining a {CPP} spin valve area of 1 mm x 1 mm. Up to now, our best samples have a spin valve magnetic behavior and exhibit up to 3\% {MR} response at low temperature for a 300 nm organic spacer layer.},

In the operating range tested, this agglomerates formation mainly depends on the fluidization conditions and not on the {CVD} parameters. The best results have been obtained for anatase {TiO2} powders for which the conditions of fluidization have been the most optimized. For these anatase powders, agglomerates are porous. {SEM} and {TEM} imaging prove that silicon nanodots (8-10 nm in size) have been deposited on the surface of particles and that this deposition is uniform on the whole powders and conformal around each grain, even if not fully continuous. Raman spectroscopy shows that the {TiO2} powders have been partially reduced into {TiO2-x} during deposition. The {TiO2} stoichiometry can be recovered by annealing under air, and {IR} spectroscopy indicates that the deposited silicon nanodots have been at least partly oxidized into {SiO2} after this annealing. 2010 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

This compound is a new member of the family of the bilayered organic-inorganic lead-iodide based perovskites. Its crystal structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The inorganic sub-lattice consists of periodic bilayers of iodoplumbate octahedra. Each {PbI6} octahedra exhibits both edge- and corner-sharing with adjacent octahedra. The vibrational properties of this compound have been studied by Raman scattering spectroscopy. Optical absorption, photoluminescence and diffuse reflectance measurements have been performed. The room-temperature bandgap and free exciton absorption hands are observed at 2.46 and 2.23 {eV}, respectively. The exciton binding energy is 230 {meV} which is the largest value ever reported till date for the bilayered {PbI} based perovskites. Calculations assuming Wannier-type quasi-two-dimensional excitons and taking into account the image potential of the exciton charges showed that nearly 64\% of the exciton binding energy is due to the dielectric confinement effect.

The wafer curvature was compensated thanks to the deposition of a thick Ge layer on the backside. We then grew, after a chemical mechanical polishing, various thickness (37-148 nm) Ge layers. They stayed smooth (root-mean-square roughness {\textless}5 angstrom) and pseudomorphically strained on the {VS} underneath ( perpendicular lattice parameter: 5.681 angstrom double left right arrow bulk Ge lattice parameter: 5.658 angstrom) up to a 74 nm thickness. These c-Ge layers were then bonded on oxidized Si substrates using the {SmartCut} ({TM)} process. The resulting c-{GeOI} substrates were of high crystalline quality, compressively strained and smooth. The threading dislocations density (8 x 10(5) cm(-2) double left right arrow 1.7 x 10(5) cm(-2) for the {SiGe} {VS} template used to strain the c-Ge layers) was indeed 20 times less than the one associated with conventional {GeOI} substrates obtained from thick Ge epilayers. Pseudo-{MOSFET} measurements were performed to quantify the hole mobility gain in those c-{GeOI} substrates. A +150\% enhancement compared to conventional silicon-on-insulator substrates was evidenced, validating the interest of these stacks.},

A dielectric constant value of 24 +/- 2 and 22 +/- 1 is obtained on Si-based and Ge-based metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors, respectively. However, the relatively good {La2O3} dielectric properties are associated with significant interface reactivity on both semiconductor substrates. This leads to the identification of a minimum critical thickness that limits the scaling down of the equivalent oxide thickness of the stack. These findings are explained by the spontaneous formation of lanthanum silicate and germanate species which takes place during the growth and also upon annealing. Although the ultimate film thickness scalability remains an unsolved concern, the use of an O-3-based process is demonstrated to be a suitable solution to fabricate {La2O3} films that can be successfully converted into the high-k hexagonal phase.

We show that plots of this effective electronic density allow for capturing the essential physics of the electron-phonon interaction and of the resonant light-scattering process in a situation where complex effects are simultaneously present: electronic confinement in the quantum wells and wave-function delocalization due to interlayer coupling, folding of acoustic dispersion and symmetry changes in the deformation fields, resonant selection of optical transitions. Comparison between the measured spectra and those simulated using the Raman-Brillouin quantum model and the photoelastic model are presented. Activation and/or deactivation of the scattering by acoustic vibration doublets and changes in their intensity ratio with excitation energy are directly related to the Raman-Brillouin electronic density distribution along the superlattices axis. Limitations of the photoelastic model are discussed by comparing the steplike variation in the photoelastic coefficient to the Raman-Brillouin electronic density profiles.},

The structures of the as-formed {DWCNTs} are strikingly similar, showing that they are not dependent on the nature of the fullerene precursor. High temperature X-ray diffraction measurements of C-70 peapods below the coalescence temperature show that confined C-70 molecules in large tubes undergo an orientational. transition to free rotations. Fast re-orientations of C-70 molecules allow cyclo-addition between adjacent fullerenes to form, in good agreement with the mechanism of coalescence proposed in the literature for C-60 molecules.

	abstract = {Terra sigillata is certainly the most famous fine ware of the Roman period, and for this reason it has been a subject of interest for both the archeology and archeometry communities. X-ray diffraction studies showed systematic differences in the mineral compositions between central Italian and south Gaul productions. All the slips contain hematite; the Gallic ones embody also a significant content of corundum, while the Italian productions contain a great proportion of spinel. Raman investigation fails to reveal directly these differences because the spectra are dominated by the hematite peaks. However, we originally demonstrate that, due to the occurrence of an upshift of bands, the Raman spectrum of these sigillata slips can be associated with a substituted hematite. This premise has been confirmed by comparing the crystallization of hematite in four annealed clays to that of the ancient slips. The results suggested that the presence of the strong additional Raman band at around 680 cm(-1) present in both clays and ancient slips could be associated with the recrystallization of hematite, occurring above 750 degrees C. It could also be due to the magnetite content, but this hypothesis is not supported by X-ray diffraction data. In addition, the reduction seems to take place only above 1050 degrees C, as suggested by the unveiling of hercynite as well as the darkening of the clay samples. Raman scattering is shown to be very sensitive to small variations in clays composition and to firing temperature, and it has been successfully used as an in situ sensitive probe for discriminating between Italian and south Gallic productions.

	abstract = {In addition to the red terra sigillata production, the largest Gallic workshop (La Graufesenque) made a special type of terra sigillata, called "marbled" by the archaeologists. Produced exclusively at this site, this pottery is characterized by a surface finish made of a mixture of yellow and red slips. Because the two slips are intimately mixed, it is difficult to obtain the precise composition of one of the two constituents without contamination from the other. In order to obtain very precise correlation at the appropriate scale between the color aspect and the elemental and mineralogical phase distributions in the slip, combined electron microprobe, X-ray micro spectroscopies and micro diffraction on cross-sectional samples were performed. The aim of this study is to discover how potters were able to produce this unique type of terra sigillata and especially this particular slip of an intense yellow color. Results show that the yellow component of marbled sigillata was made from a titanium-rich clay preparation. The color is due to the formation of a pseudobrookite ({TiFe(2)O(5))} phase in the yellow part of the slip, the main characteristics of that structure being considered nowadays as essential for the fabrication of stable yellow ceramic pigments. Its physical properties such as high refractive indices and a melting point higher than that of most silicates widely used as ceramic colorants are indeed determinant for this kind of application. Finally, the red parts have a similar composition (elementary and mineralogical) to the one of standard red slip.},

Based on simulations of the optical extinction spectra and of the electric near-field intensity maps, the resonances are assigned to a single trimer response and to collective surface plasmon excitations involving electromagnetic interaction between the trimers.

The high pulsed magnetic fields up to 33 T were used in the 120-310 K temperature range. Comparison between longitudinal and transverse (with respect to the film plane) field configurations was made in the low-field and high-field regimes in order to clarify the nature of the measured negative magnetoresistance. Coexistence of two distinct magnetic fractions, superparamagnetic ({SPM}, consisting of small spherical Co-Fe granules) and superferromagnetic ({SFM}, by bigger Co-Fe clusters), was established in this system. These fractions were shown to have different relevance for the system magnetization and magnetotransport. While the magnetization is almost completely (up to similar to 97\%) defined by the {SFM} contribution and practically independent of temperature (in this range), the magnetoresistance experiences a crossover from a regime dominated by Langevin correlations (suppressed with temperature) between neighbor {SPM} and {SFM} moments at low fields, to that dominated by spin scattering (enhanced with temperature) of charge carriers within {SFM} clusters at high fields. Also, the demagnetizing effects, sensitive to the field orientation, were found to essentially define the low-field behavior and characteristic crossover field.},

Based on numerical simulations of the optical extinction spectra and of the electric near-field intensity maps, the resonances are assigned to surface plasmon states arising from the strong intra-trimer electromagnetic interaction. We show that the nanoring trimer configuration allows for generating infrared surface plasmon resonances associated with strongly localized electromagnetic energy, thus providing plasmonic nanoresonators well-suited for sensing and surface enhanced near-infrared Raman spectroscopy.

Their prospective applications include, for example, data storage devices, single-electron transistors and spin-qubit arrays for quantum computing. However, the present incomplete understanding of how a nanotube is affected by entrapped fullerenes is an obstacle for peapods to reach their full potential in nanoscale electronic applications. In this paper, we investigate the effect of C-60 fullerenes on low-temperature electron transport through peapod quantum dots. Compared with empty nanotubes, we find an abnormal temperature dependence of Coulomb blockade oscillations, indicating the presence of a nanoelectromechanical coupling between electronic states of the nanotube and mechanical vibrations of fullerenes. This provides a method to detect the C-60 presence and to probe the interplay between electrical and mechanical excitations in peapods, which thus emerge as a new class of nanoelectromechanical systems.},

The color reflected by this structure depends on material parameters such as the molecular chirality or the concentration of chiral dopant, the helical pitch of the twisted structure and the optical indices. In the present publication, we show that the color may be selected simply by varying the annealing time of a cholesteric oligomer film with hybrid anchoring. Experimental and simulated transmittance spectra reveal the color shift. The three-dimensional representation of the structure is provided from the macroscopic scale to the mesoscale by combining complementary imaging techniques (optical microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopies, atomic force microscopy) to image the texture in different directions. We show that the color selectivity is due to controlled changes of the orientation of the helical axis with respect to the air-material interface. The optical behavior is described with a single parameter, which is the angle between the film surface normal and the orientation within the film of the helical axis. Potential applications in the field of chiro-optical devices concern self-assembled chiral microreflectors fabricated via a low-cost controllable thermal process.

A cholesteric liquid crystal that presents a twist inversion at a critical temperature T-c is blended with a small quantity of photopolymerizable monomers. Upon ultraviolet irradiation above T-c, the liquid crystal becomes a polymer-stabilized liquid crystal. Below T-c, the material reflects a dual circularly polarized band in the infrared.

Block-copolymer ({BC)-based} lithography is a powerful tool for the fabrication of uniform, densely spaced nanometer-scale features over large areas. Following this bottom-up approach, nanoporous polymeric films can be deposited on any type of substrate. The nanoporous periodic template can be transferred to the underlying substrate by dry anisotropic etching. Nevertheless the physical sizes of the polymeric mask represent an important limitation in the implementation of suitable lithographic protocols based on {BC} technology, since the diameter and the center-to-center distance of the pores cannot be varied independently in this class of materials. This problem could be overcome by combining block copolymer technology with atomic layer deposition ({ALD):} by means of {BC-based} lithography a nanoporous {SiO(2)} template, with well-reproducible characteristic dimensions, can be fabricated and subsequently used as a backbone for the growth of perfectly conformal thin oxide films by {ALD.} In this work polystyrene-b-poly(methylmethacrylate) ({PS-b-PMMA)} {BC} and reactive ion etching are used to fabricate hexagonally packed 23 nm wide nanopores in a 50 nm thick {SiO(2)} matrix. By {ALD} deposition of Al({2)O(3)} thin films onto the nanoporous {SiO(2)} templates, nanostructured Al({2)O(3)} surfaces are obtained.

We demonstrate that the growth is of Volmer-Weber type and show that epitaxy of islands could be reached at elevated temperature. The island morphology is governed by surface energy minimization, leading to well defined islands whose size depends on the nominal thickness. At 750 degrees C, the appearance of two island populations reveals that although the two studied growth temperatures are quite close, the growth kinetic is static at 650 degrees C and dynamic at 750 degrees C. Due to the lattice misfit between Pt and {Al2O3}, X-ray and electron diffractions reveal that the islands undergo an in-plane compression accompanied with an out-of-plane tension and such strains relax with thickness to reach the bulk lattice parameter above 10 nm when the Pt film becomes continuous. Electron microscopy in high resolution mode allows measuring the strain in isolated islands and corroborates X-ray diffraction measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.3556769},
	abstract = {The quantitative analysis of magnetic oxide core level spectra can become complicated when the magnetic atoms are located at several nonequivalent atomic sites in the crystal. This is, for instance, the case for Fe atoms in magnetite, which are located in tetrahedral and octahedral atomic sites; in this case, the x-ray magnetic circular dichroic ({XMCD)} spectra recorded at the L(2,3) edge of Fe contain contributions from the different nonequivalent atomic sites, which unfortunately cannot be separated. Energy loss magnetic chiral dichroic ({EMCD)} spectra are the transmission electron microscope analogies of the {XMCD} spectra. One of the important differences between these two techniques of magnetic analysis is that {EMCD} uses a fast electron beam instead of polarized light. The fast electrons behave like Bloch states in the sample, and the fine structure of the {EMCD} spectra is strongly influenced by channeling and dynamical diffraction effects. These effects can be adjusted by changing the experimental configuration. We use theoretical calculations, which include dynamical diffraction effects and in which electronic transitions are treated in the atomic multiplet formalism, to show that the relative weight of the Fe atoms in different nonequivalent atomic sites can be changed by a proper choice of the position of the detector and of the magnetite sample orientation and thickness. We conclude that {EMCD} spectra could be used to isolate the magnetic contribution of atoms in each of the nonequivalent atomic sites, which would not be possible with {XMCD} techniques.

Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal an intricate strain distribution, with gradients in both the vertical and, unexpectedly, the horizontal direction. These gradients generate a horizontal flexoelectricity that forces the spontaneous polarization to rotate away from the normal.

Good agreement between simulated and measured mobility is obtained using strain components measured directly at device level by a novel holographic technique. A large vertical compressive strain is observed in metal gate {FinFETs}, and the simulations show that this helps recover the electron mobility disadvantage of the (110) {FinFET} lateral interfaces with respect to (100) interfaces, with no degradation of the hole mobility. The model is then used to systematically explore the impact of stress components in the fin width, height, and length directions on the mobility of both n- and p-type {FinFETs} and to identify optimal stress configurations. Finally, self-consistent Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate how the most favorable stress configurations can improve the {ON} current of nanoscale {MOSFETs.}},

The diameter of these nanoparticles increases with the deposited silicon percentage from 18 to 36 nm whereas their density remains constant at 5 10(22) nanoparticles/g of {CNT.} This indicates a low affinity of chemical species born from silane pyrolysis with the {CNT} surface for nucleation. The increase of the silicon nanoparticles diameter leads to the decrease of the specific surface area and the porous volume of the balls, probably due to the filling of the pores of the {CNT} network by silicon. A slight increase of the mean diameter of the balls was observed for the two highest silicon percentages, certainly due to the ability of the {CNT} network to be deformed under the mechanical stress induced by the silicon nanoparticles growth.},

The filler/matrix interactions in nanocomposites are investigated by means of thermo-physical measurements: differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetry. The resulting morphology shows particles individually dispersed in the matrix. The fire tests present a fire-resistance effect at low filler content despite a different behavior as a function of the matrix. For instance, with only 2\% volume of boehmite, the burning time of {LDPE} composite is significantly increased by 15\%. At the same filler content in {PA6}, the burning time is solely increased by 4.5\%. On the other hand, the limiting oxygen index is increased by +7.0\% (only 2.6\% with {LDPE} composites).

The validity of this model has been tested on a set of experimental results describing the thermal oxidation of suspended silicon {NWs.} The {NWs} oxidation is examined upon different atmospheres (pure O(2) and H({2)O)} and at different thermal budgets by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements. The good agreement between the experimental results and the simulations confirm the validity of the key model assumptions: the {SiO(2)} flow can be approximated as purely viscous and the non-linear effects of shear stress on oxide viscosity [S. M. Hu, J. Appl. Phys. 64, 323 (1988)] can be neglected. In addition, the model gives some interesting insight about the physics of the oxidation process. In particular, we demonstrate that the compressive stress at the {Si/SiO(2)} interfaces is the main parameter controlling the experimentally observed self-limitation of the oxidation rate for long oxidation times. Finally, it will be shown that thermal oxidation can be used to not only to decrease the core diameter and round off the nanostructures but also to reduce the size dispersion of a nanowire assembly and that our predictive model can be employed to optimize this process.

First, short annealing times were used to limit the diffusion of dopants and to match the conditions needed for the realization of shallow junctions. Sb is not well suited to achieve high activation levels because honeycomb voids can already form at doses of 3 x 10(14) cm(-2). Of the other two, P is a better candidate than As because it was possible to maximize the activation level to up to about 4.5 x 10(19) cm(-3) without noticeable diffusion. This absolute value has only a limited accuracy, though, since the mobility models available in literature lead to values which differ by more than one order of magnitude. Longer annealing times were then used to study the redistribution of the dopants. For P. a model based on migration predominantly via complexes with doubly negatively charged vacancies and dopant loss was implemented which allowed the simultaneous simulation of our experimental profiles with one set of parameters. The extracted diffusion coefficient with an activation energy of 2.2 {eV} is comparable to the results obtained in previous studies. No noticeable P clustering was observed in these experiments. The model was then adapted to simulate the redistribution of As and Sb. For Sb, clustering is apparent in the diffusion profiles and has to be taken into account in the simulations.

The thin films, grown on alpha-{Al2O3(0001)} single crystals or Pt(111) buffer layers by oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy, exhibit high structural order with sharp interfaces and low roughness. The electrical and magnetic properties are carefully investigated and it is shown that {MnFe2O4(111)} ultrathin films keep an insulating and ferrimagnetic behavior at room temperature. Special attention is given to the iron/manganese valence state and the cationic ordering. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal that thin films contain mainly Fe3+ and Mn2+ cations, distributed predominantly in a normal spinel structure. This study proves the high potential of {MnFe2O4} to be used as a magnetic tunnel barrier for spin filtering applications at room temperature.},

Nevertheless, there is little known about their potential ecotoxicity. Consequently, the impact of {CNTs} on the environment must be taken into consideration. This work evaluates the potential impact of well characterized double-walled carbon nanotubes ({DWNTs)} in the amphibian larvae Xenopus laevis under normalized laboratory conditions according to the International Standard micronucleus assay {ISO} 21427-1: 2006 for 12 days of half-static exposure to 0.1-1-10 and 50 mg L(-1) of {DWNTs} in water. Two different endpoints were carried out: (i) toxicity (mortality and growth of larvae) and (ii) genotoxicity (induction of micronucleated erythrocytes). Moreover, intestine of larvae were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The {DWNTs} synthetized by catalytic chemical vapor deposition ({CCVD)} were used as produce (experiment I) and the addition of Gum Arabic ({GA)} was investigated to improve the stability of the aqueous suspensions (experiment {II).} The results show growth inhibition in larvae exposed to 10 and 50 mg L(-1) of {DWNTs} with or without {GA.} No genotoxicity was evidenced in erythrocytes of larvae exposed to {DWNTs}, except to 1 mg L(-1) of {DWNTs} with {GA} suggesting its potential effect in association with {DWNTs} at the first nonacutely toxic concentration. The Raman analysis confirmed the presence of {DWNTs} into the lumen of intestine but not in intestinal tissues and cells, nor in the circulating blood of exposed larvae.

The oxysulfide {Gd2O2S:Eu3+} {NPs} emit strong red luminescence at 624 nm when excited by near {UV} (363 nm) or by X-rays. They may thus be considered as nano-phosphors and nano-scintillators.

The luminescence intensity of europium in gadolinium oxysulfide {NPs} has been maintained in the amino-silica coated particles {Gd2O2S:Eu3+@SiO2-APTMS}, whereas it has been significantly enhanced in the mesoporous lsilica coated {Gd2O2S:Eu3+@mSiO(2).} This versatile new nanoplatform can be easily internalized in living {NIH3T3} mouse cells.

The spectral line widths are comparable to what has been observed for individual single wall carbon nanotubes ({SWs)} or graphene. The spectral position of the inner tube is consistent with previous extrapolations from measurements under high pressure and on chemically doped double wall tubes.

We show that the engine efficiency with perfect regeneration doesn't depend on the regenerator dead volume but this dead volume strongly amplifies the imperfect regeneration effect.

The interface-induced modification of the intensity ratio I(L({3))/I(L(2))} which has been measured by electron energy loss spectroscopy is in good agreement with the enhancement of the magnetic moment calculated from first principles. This shows that the intensity ratio can be used to obtain information on magnetic moments at a nanometer scale in a transmission electron microscope.},

The dynamic response was investigated in the linear regime measuring the ferromagnetic resonance response of the Py layers using broadband vector network analyzer technique. Both the static and the dynamic properties suggest the possible presence of a thermally induced spin reorientation transition in the Py interface at temperatures around 60 K in all the samples investigated. It seems, however, that the details of the interface between Py and the hardening ferromagnet/insulator structure, the atomic structure of Py layers (amorphous vs. textured) as well as the presence of dipolar coupling through the insulating barrier in the magnetic tunnel junction structures could strongly influence this low temperature reorientation transition. Our conclusions are indirectly supported by structural characterization of the samples by means of X-Ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. Micromagnetic simulations indicate the possibility of strongly enhanced surface anisotropy in thin Py films over {CoFe} or {CoFeB} underlayers. Comparison of the simulations with experimental results also shows that the thermally-induced spin reorientation transition could be influenced by the presence of strong disorder at the surface.},

For excitation close to resonance with-the localized surface plasmons of the nanodisk trimers, we are able to detect several intense Raman bands generated by the spherical gold nanoparticles. On the basis of both vibrational dynamics calculations and Raman selection rules, the measured Raman bands are assigned to fundamental and overtones of the quadrupolar and breathing vibration modes of the spherical gold nanoparticles. Simulations of the electric near-field intensity maps performed at the Raman probe wavelengths showed strong localization of the optical energy in the vicinity of the nanodisk trimers, thus corroborating the role of the interaction between the acoustic vibrations of the spherical nanoparticles and the surface plasmons of the nanodisk trimers. Acoustic phonons surface enhanced Raman scattering is here demonstrated for the first time for such coupled plasmonic systems.

So, at an appropriate frequency, a microwave incident magnetic field interacts with the film and generates heating. This heating is recorded using an infrared camera to provide magnetic field pattern images. This setup yields qualitative results and allows for magnetic field detection on a large dimension scale.

The multiple branching was achieved by breaking the face-centered-cubic lattice symmetry of gold through copper-induced formation of single or double twins, and the resulting gold nanocrosses exhibited pronounced near-{IR} absorption with a great extension to the mid-{IR} region. As studied by discrete dipole approximation ({DDA)} simulations, the entire nanocross gets excited even when one of the branches is exposed to incident light. The above properties make them useful as octopus antennas for capturing near-{IR} light for effective photothermal destruction of cells. The cell damage process was analyzed using the Arrhenius model, and its intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics were determined quantitatively. Besides effective photothermal treatment and two-photon luminescence imaging, the near- and mid-{IR-absorbing} gold nanocrosses may also find applications in {IR} sensing, thermal imaging, telecommunications, and the like.},

We found that the penetration of the gold nanoparticles within the liquid crystal modulation depends on the initial concentration of nanoparticles in the colloidal solution. Two distinct regimes are pointed out: (i) at low concentration the nanoparticles are weakly interacting and embedded in a homeotropic environment at the film surface and (ii) at high concentration the penetration of the {NPs} occurs within the modulation, and their localized surface plasmon resonance is strongly red-shifted due to nanoparticles packing and electromagnetic interactions between the nanoparticles.

Depending on the use of dried or never-dried {BC} membranes two main kinds of composites were obtained. In the first one dried {BC} membranes coated with the hybrid sol have lead to transparent membranes displaying a hi-phase structure where the two components could be easily distinguished, with individual structures preserved. A decrease was observed for tensile strength (50.5 {MPa)} and Young's Modulus (2.8 {GPa)} when compared to pure {BC} membrane (112.5 {MPa} and 12.7 {GPa).} Elongation at break was observed to increase (2.5\% against 1.5\% observed for {BC).} When never-dried {BC} membranes were used transparent membranes were also obtained, however an improvement was observed for mechanical properties (tensile strength - 116 {MPa} and Young's Modulus - 13.7 {GPa).} A lower value was obtained for the elongation at break (1.3\%).

Under such conditions, fullerenes strongly absorb the laser energy, open, and break, while the containing {SWCNT} merely acts as both a nanoreactor and a mold which is only weakly heated by the laser. The containing tube confines the fullerene fragments, promotes their reconstruction into an inner tube, and protects them from air oxidation. This leads to the overall formation of double-walled carbon nanotubes ({DWCNTs).} The transformation is found to strongly depend on the laser irradiance and dose. This proves that the related mechanism is a multiphoton photolysis, different from the previous heat-induced transformation attempts found in the literature, whether the heat is produced by means of a thermostat, infrared laser, or nonresonant {UV} laser. The actual peapod-to-{DWCNT} transformation is monitored by Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.},

We show that the color may be selected simply by varying the annealing time of an open cholesteric oligomer film with hybrid anchoring. The {3D} representation of the structure is provided by combining complementary imaging techniques. The color selectivity is due to controlled changes of the orientation of the helix axis with respect to the air-material interface. Potential applications are chiral microreflectors and microlenses. Then, we demonstrate the symbiotic association of gold nanoparticles within such cholesteric textures and their long-range self-organized arrangements. We show that the nanoparticles can be patterned on demand only by playing with the film thickness and the interfacial properties of the {CLC} film. We investigate how the selective reflection is affected by the in situ organization of gold nanoparticles and what is the plasmon response of nanoparticle chains.

	abstract = {An attractive alternative for extending the scaling of Flash-type memories is to replace the conventional floating gate (a poly-Si layer) by laterally isolated floating nodes in the form of nanoparticles. This floating-gate concept has led to the emergence of the so-called nanocrystal ({NC)} memories which have the potential of operating at lower voltages and higher speeds compared to the conventional non-volatile memories ({NVMs)} without compromising the criterion of non-volatility. {NC} memories also offer other advantages like a better immunity to the crosstalk effect arising from the floating-gate coupling of closely spaced adjacent cells and an increased design flexibility from which quantum confinement phenomena can be judiciously exploited for enhanced memory functionality. Among the different technological routes explored in the last few years for generating nanocrystals in the gate insulator of {MOS} devices, two major techniques have been utilized, namely deposition in vacuum and ion beam synthesis. During the last decade, we have extensively explored the ultra-low-energy ion-beam-synthesis ({ULE-IBS)} technique to produce single planes of Si-{NCs} in very thin (5-10 nm) insulator layers. This review summarizes more than 10 years of research efforts we and other groups have dedicated to the fabrication of {NCs} memories using this original technique. By exploiting the flexibility of the {ULE-IBS} route, Si-{NCs} single-transistor {NVM} cells using "classical" gate oxides ({SiO2)} have been successfully realized. More recently, advanced dielectric stacks employing high-kappa dielectric ({HfO2)} as tunnel oxide and {SiN} as control oxide and host matrix for Si and Ge-{NCs}, have been fabricated and show promising performance for low-voltage operating-{NVM} devices. Particular emphasis is placed herein on material science issues such as anomalous and controlled oxidation processes. While much research is still needed for making reliable and competitive {NC} {NVMs}, our systematic investigations based on the {ULE-IBS} option demonstrate that a tight control and understanding of the properties of {NCs} memory cells can be achieved, provided that deep structural characterization is coupled to electrical studies.

We demonstrate that these unexpected behaviors originate from a minority spin state with Delta(1) symmetry that exists below the Fermi level for high Co concentration. Using angle-resolved photoemission, this state is shown to be a two-dimensional state that occurs at both Fe1-{xCox(001)} free surface, and more importantly at the interface with {MgO.} The combination of this interface state with the peculiar density of empty states due to chemical disorder allows us to describe in details the complex conduction behavior in this system.},

	abstract = {This work presents an experimental and theoretical identification of defects and morphologies of a high-angle near-90 degrees tilt Si ((1) over bar 10)//(001) boundary created by direct wafer bonding. Two samples with different twist misorientations, between the ((1) over bar 10) layer and the (001) substrate, were studied using conventional transmission electron microscopy ({TEM)} and geometric phase analysis of high-resolution {TEM} images. The O-lattice theory was used for atom reconstruction of the interface along the [1 (1) over bar0](sub)//[001](lay) direction. It is demonstrated that to preserve covalent bonding across the interface, it should consist of \{1 (1) over bar1\}(sub,lay)//\{(1) over bar 12\}(lay,sub) facets intersected by maximum of six \{1 (1) over bar1\}(sub,lay) planes with three 90 degrees Shockley dislocations per facet. It is shown that a particular atom reconstruction is needed at transition points from one facet to another. The presence or absence of deviation from exact 90 degrees tilt of the layer with respect to the substrate is shown to be related directly to the undulations of the interface. It is demonstrated that the latter has an influence on the Burgers vector of the dislocations adjusting in-plane twist misorientation. A general model for cubic face-centered materials for an arbitrary {\textless} 110 {\textgreater}(sub,lay) tilt interface is proposed, which predicts the net Burgers vector and the spacing between dislocations necessary to realize transition from the lattice of the substrate (layer) to the layer (substrate).

In this paper, we investigate the electrical transport properties, at room and low temperature, in as-grown three-dimensional ({3D)} vertically stacked germanium (Ge)-enriched nanowires. Measurements using the Pseudo-{MOSFET} (Psi-{MOSFET)} concept show that the transport in gateless nanowires is controlled by the voltage applied on the substrate, as in a {MOS} transistor. Interestingly, the substrate bias effect depends on the designed geometry of the nanowire. In nanowires with high width/length aspect ratio, we show the possibility of turning on both electron and hole channels. For nanowires with small width/length ratio, only the hole channel is visible. The impact of series resistance on the drain current level is reported. Transport modification with the concentration of germanium in the nanostructures is also discussed. Low-temperature measurements show the variation of electrical parameters such as threshold voltage, flatband voltage, subthreshold swing and mobility.

After mask removal the samples are furnace annealed at 1050 degrees C for 30 min under N-2 atmosphere. Control of Si-{NCs} characteristics was examined as a function of the stencil aperture size. Then, different patterns of Si-{NCs} pockets were synthesized such as squares and gratings of line arrays. Photoluminescence ({PL)} spectroscopy under a confocal microscope was employed to map the {NCs} pocket arrays. These {PL} images were found to perfectly mimic the mask geometry. A change in {PL} intensity and a blueshift of the {PL} energy peak were observed near the edge of the pockets. These local changes were attributed to both a smaller size and a higher density of Si-{NCs} in such areas, probably due to a local decrease of the implanted fluence. {AFM} measurements of the oxide swelling as a function of the elaboration conditions were combined to {PL} results to evaluate the real implanted fluence, which is lower than the nominal one. The implanted fluence was also found to decrease with decreasing aperture size, until a threshold for the absence of Si-{NCs} formation is reached in sub-micron patterns.

We give a detailed database on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induced by interfaces and on the total magnetic anisotropy energy including the shape anisotropy of the superlattices. The magnetic anisotropy is analyzed in terms of the anisotropy of the Co and Ni orbital magnetic moments and in terms of the electron states of the superlattices. Most of our results apply to superlattices with an fcc stacking of the atomic layers, but we also study the influence of stacking faults on the anisotropy. We describe the magnetization, and the density of states and spin polarization at the Fermi level of all these superlattices. The database which we provide should help researchers who aim to design {Co/Ni-based} magnetic or spintronic devices with suitable physical properties.},

	abstract = {We explore the origins of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in epitaxial and textured {Co/Ni(111)} superlattices using a combination of thin-film growth, structural characterization, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism ({XMCD)}, and ab initio calculations. Transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction experiments allow us to show that the "bulk" magnetoelastic contribution to the total magnetic energy is small compared to the interface anisotropy. The magnetic properties are studied by using {XMCD} at the Co and Ni L-{2,L-3} edges. Hysteresis loops performed at the Co L-3 edge confirm the perpendicular magnetization for Co thicknesses up to four monolayers. The spin and orbital moments were deduced using the {XMCD} sum rules. The results are explained by considering two kinds of magnetic moments for Co, distinguishing the interfaces from the rest of the layers. Both effective spin and orbital moments of Co atoms are found to be enhanced at the Co-Ni interfaces, whereas the magnetic moment of Co surrounded by Co is similar to the bulk value. Ab initio calculations allow us to show a strong enhancement of the dipole operator contribution on Co atoms at the interface that is partly responsible for this high effective spin moment at the interface. Such a moment enhancement is not observed for Ni, with the dipole operator contribution being close to zero. Finally, we observed a very surprising proportionality between the effective spin and orbital moments, independent of the absorption edge or deposition technique used. We assign this peculiar behavior to the fact that the magnetic dipole operator involved in the sum rules is closely linked to the increase of the Co orbital moment at the interface. Based on {XMCD} results obtained on both molecular beam epitaxy and sputter-deposited samples, this link allows us to show the extreme sensitivity of the perpendicular anisotropy with the chemical ordering at the interface.},

We propose a thorough investigation of the optical properties of Si1-{xGex} alloy nanowires addressing the influence of {NW} diameter, composition, light polarization, and angle of incidence on their scattering and absorption. Our results clearly show that the Ge composition provides an additional degree of freedom to tailor the optical response of these one-dimensional nano-objects and that resonant enhancement of both absorption and scattering can be obtained in the infrared range at relatively small diameters compared to pure Si nanowires.

A local thermometry method based on the measurement of the resonant frequency of the dielectric resonator placed on the {YBa2Cu3O7-delta} thin film shows that the H-rf-induced flux penetration is due to the increase of the film temperature.

This is corroborated by the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence, which pointed out a first-order order-disorder phase transition at similar to 375 K, with a hysteresis loop of 40 K width. Raman spectroscopy data suggest that this transition arises from a dynamic rotational disordering of the ammonium headgroups of the alkylammonium chain. In contrast, differential scanning calorimetry measurements on a pellet sample led to an entropy change value Delta S approximate to 0.39 {J/K/mol} at the transition, suggesting the existence of a residual short-range order of the {NH3+} on cooling from the high temperature phase.

Under {UV} excitation, a strong visible photoluminescence emission, due to the radiative recombinations of the electron-hole pairs photo-generated in the {ZnO} nanoparticles, was observed. This optical property, together with the easy synthesis process, makes the {ZnO} {CNCs} a promising candidate for applications in optoelectronics and photocatalysis.

In technology, it is found in temperature and pressure sensors, supertwisted nematic liquid crystal displays, optical filters, reflective devices, or cosmetics. A cholesteric liquid crystal reflects light because of its helical structure. The reflection is selective the bandwidth is limited to a few tens of nanometers and the reflectance is equal to at most 50\% for unpolarized incident light, which is a consequence of the polarization-selectivity rule. These limits must be exceeded for innovative applications like polarizer-free reflective displays, broadband polarizers, optical data storage media, polarization-independent devices, stealth technologies, or smart switchable reflective windows to control solar light and heat. Novel cholesteric-liquid-crystalline architectures with the related fabrication procedures must therefore be developed. This article reviews solutions found in living matter and laboratories to broaden the bandwidth around a central reflection wavelength, do without the polarization-selectivity rule and go beyond the reflectance limit.},

In this work we propose a novel method combining apparent strain analysis from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ({HREM)} images and theoretical modeling based on continuum elasticity theory and tight-binding atomistic simulations to map and measure the nanoscale curvature of graphene folds and wrinkles.

We report on the dependence of functional properties (superconducting critical temperature, residual resistance and alpha) as well as on microstructure, chemical composition and interface quality for optimized high quality {Mo/Au} bilayers on annealing temperature and time. Data show that the functional properties of the bilayers remain stable at T {\textless} 150 degrees C, but changes in microstructure, interface quality and functional properties were observed for layers heated at T {\textgreater}= 200 degrees C. Microstructural and chemical composition data suggest that the measured changes in residual resistance ratio ({RRR)} and {TC} at T {\textgreater}= 200 degrees C are mainly due to an increase in the average Au grain size and to Au migration along the Mo grain boundaries at the {Au/Mo} interface.

We are able to determine the charge transfer without any additional parameter using the spectral signature of inner and outer walls of double-wall carbon nanotubes. While for the outer wall both the lattice contraction and nondiabatic effects contribute to the phonon shift, only the lattice contraction contributes for the inner nanotube. For the outer nanotube, we are able to separate these two contributions of the Raman G-band shift as a function of the charge transfer. We have carried out density functional theory calculations on graphene to see how different chemical species ({HSO4-}, {H2SO4}, H+) affect the electronic band structure and electron-phonon coupling. The Raman G-band shift for the outer nanotube, Delta omega, as a function of hole charge transfer per carbon atom, f(C), is found to be Delta omega (cm(-1)) = (350 +/- 20)f(C) + (101 +/- 8)root f(C).},

This was correlated with the physical properties of the plasma as studied by optical emission spectroscopy and with the temperature of the gaseous atmosphere surrounding the plasma as measured using thermocouples. Nanotube yield and purity were evaluated from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Results showed a strong influence of the heterogeneous anode grain size. It was found that the optimal synthesis conditions correspond to an arc chamber volume of 25 L and a graphite grain size of 1 mu m. In that case the plasma temperature and the carbon over nickel concentration ratio in the plasma differ notably from those observed under the other synthesis conditions. It was also found that a slower temperature rise of the gaseous atmosphere surrounding the plasma and a higher anode erosion rate are associated with a higher {SWCNT} yield.

We have exploited this longitudinal absorption band to efficiently confine light fields and concentrate heat sources in the dose vicinity of these plasmonic chain networks. The mapping of the two phenomena on the same superstructures was performed by combining two-photon luminescence and fluorescence polarization anisotropy imaging techniques. Besides the light and heat concentration, we show experimentally that the planar spatial distribution of optical field intensity can be simply modulated by controlling the linear polarization of the incident optical excitation. On the contrary, the heat production, which is obtained here by exciting the structures within the optically transparent window of biological tissues, is evenly spread over the entire {PNN.} This contrasts with the usual case of localized heating in continuous nanowires, thus opening opportunities for these networks in light-induced hyperthermia applications. Furthermore, we propose a unified theoretical framework to account for both the nonlinear optical and thermal near-fields around {PNN.} The associated numerical simulations, based on a Green's function formalism, are in excellent agreement with the experimental images. This formalism therefore provides a versatile tool for the accurate engineering of optical and thermodynamical properties of complex plasmonic colloidal architectures.},

Moreover, we report the first direct observation of spatially resolved excitonic photoluminescence in this type of materials using dark-field imaging of white-light pumped photoluminescence. Owing to the rapid acquisition time of the dark-field images, their temperature dependence was studied, and the thermal behavior of the photoluminescence was investigated using this technique.

The formation of {Si/Ge} axial heterojunctions is a challenging task to obtain straight, defect free and extended {NWs.} And the control of the interface will determine the future device properties. This paper reports the growth and analysis of {NWs} consisting of an axial {Si/Ge} heterostructure grown by a vapor-liquid-solid process. The composition gradient and the strain distribution at the heterointerface were measured by advanced quantitative electron microscopy methods with a resolution at the nanometer scale. The transition from pure Ge to pure Si shows an exponential slope with a transition width of 21 nm for a {NW} diameter of 31 nm. Although diffuse, the heterointerface makes possible strain engineering along the axis of the {NW.} The interface is dislocation-free and a tensile out-of-plane strain is noticeable in the Ge section of the {NW}, indicating a lattice accommodation. Experimental results were compared to finite element calculations.},

We focus here on the local determination of strain and related Ge concentration. First, a Ge amorphous layer is predeposited on a Si substrate. Successive laser pulses induce the incorporation of Ge atoms in the molten substrate layer and lead to the synthesis of a graded Si1-{xGex} alloy over a depth which depends on the laser fluence. The Si1-{xGex} layers are coherently strained and free of defects. The in-depth Ge concentration distribution is investigated by {RBS} and {HAADF} {STEM.} The strain fields are specifically explored using the new dark-field electron holography (Holodark) technique, offering mapping of the full strain tensor in two dimensions with a high precision. Independently determined strain and Ge concentration distributions over a distance of 150 nm from the surface are found to be well consistent. An unexpected but reproducible depletion of Ge is evidenced inside the {SiGe} layer. This feature is shown to be related to the shape of the temporal characteristics of laser pulses. In particular, the second contribution, which occurs 32 ns later, is involved in a two-stage solidification process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Thickness uniformity of the silicon top layer is extremely important for the next generation of {CMOS} electronics based on Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator ({FD-SOI)} wafers. It requires accurate thickness characterization over a wide spatial bandwidth, from transistor to wafer scales [10 nm-300 mm]. We propose a data processing method using one-dimensional Power Spectral Density functions to describe both roughness and thickness variations of thin layers over the bandwidth of interest. The study of the correlation between thickness and roughness of the silicon top layer of {SOI} wafers leads to the distinction of three spectral domains: high-frequencies, where thickness variations are larger than roughness variations, mid-frequencies, where thickness and roughness variations are comparable, and low-frequencies, where the top layer conformably follows the buried oxide roughness. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of thickness variations, points out fractal behaviors over three regions (scaling exponent 0.3, 1.2 and 0.2 respectively). These regions provide the spectral foot-prints of fracture propagation [1.10(-5)-2.10(-3) mu m(-1)], surface self-diffusion [0.3-1 mu m(-1)] and sacrificial oxidation [1-10 mu m(-1)] respectively, all phenomena involved in fabrication of {SOI} wafers by the ion-cut process. Additionally, over the mid-frequencies region [0.03-1 mu m(-1)], we observe a "bump" which results from the depth and size-distribution of micro-cracks generated during the ion-implantation step.

We observe that the covering process leads to drastic changes in Ag content, which are interpreted in terms of sputtering of Ag atoms promoted by the incoming Al ions. This Ag sputtering process is avoided as soon as the nanoparticles are embedded under a subnanometer-thick layer of amorphous {Al2O3.} Meanwhile, the spectral position of the nanoparticles' characteristic surface plasmon resonance, measured immediately after the film growth, is not significantly affected by the deposition of the covering layer. Nevertheless, the resonance band associated with uncovered Ag nanopartides has vanished after 12 months, as a result of their oxidation. Embedding the nanopartides under a subnanometer-thick layer of amorphous {Al2O3} is enough to avoid the observed atmospheric aging processes as well as to preserve the features of their surface plasmon resonance. The results presented here are therefore promising in view of the pulsed laser deposition-based elaboration, at the wafer scale, of robust and stable tailor-made plasmonic substrates that may potentially present high electromagnetic coupling with their environment due to the very small distance to the nanostructure surface.},

We show that low dose implantation leads to the formation of a well-defined single plane of nanocrystals, while for larger doses, sputtering and diffusion effects limit the control of the size, position, and volume amount of these nanocrystals. This paper provides the experimental evidence of the incorporated dose saturation predicted in the literature when implanting metal ions at high doses in glass matrices. Its consequences on the particle population and the plasmonic optical response of the composite layers are carefully analyzed. We show here that this saturation phenomenon is underestimated in standard simulation predictions due to diffusion of metal atoms towards the surface and nanocrystal nucleation during the implantation process.

Their presence at significant levels leads to the localization of extra electrons onto reduced Fe2+ sites, while Ti remains solely +4. The magnetic and transport properties of these films are reviewed in the light of the present results regarding their ferrimagnetic character correlated with the Fe2+ modulation and their semi-conducting behavior interpreted by an Efros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping conduction regime via Fe2+ and Fe3+ centers.

Our results show that several processes (damage, diffusion, oxidation.) that depend on the Ge implanted dose, take place during the synthesis and complicate the expected behavior of the ion beam synthesized system. However, significant memory windows with good retention properties have been observed in these stack structures, indicating their feasibility for low operating voltage, non-volatile memory devices.

While classical techniques such as weak-beam dark field ({WBDF)} and Fresnel contrast imaging have been at the core of defect characterization for decades, new techniques making use of geometric phase analysis ({GPA)} of high resolution transmission electron microscopy ({HRTEM)} images or electron holography can provide complementary information, in particular the amplitude of Burgers vectors of dislocations. This chapter describes the techniques and methodologies that are to be used to study quantitatively populations of ion implantation induced defects. The defects are separated into two classes: those formed by the agglomeration of "excess atoms", that is Si self-interstitials and/or impurities (traditionally named extrinsic) and those formed by the condensation of vacancies (traditionally named intrinsic).

The ability to fluidize of these nanotubes forming ball-shaped jumbles of several hundreds of microns in diameter and that of the final {CNT-Si} balls was first studied. These balls reveal to fluidize with characteristics of Geldart's group A particles, i.e. without bubbles and with high bed expansion. Coating experiments from silane {SiH4} were performed at 500 degrees C in the 30-60 wt.\% range of silicon deposited. {SEM} and {TEM} imaging reveals that the nanotubes are coated by silicon nanoparticles uniformly distributed from the periphery to the center of the balls for the whole conditions tested. On-line acquisition of key process parameters evolution shows that the material remains fluidizable, even for large proportions of silicon deposited. The Sauter diameter and the tapped, untapped and skeleton densities of balls increase with the percentage of silicon deposited, whereas their specific surface area decreases due to the progressive filling of the pores by the deposit. This composite material is a promising candidate as anode to replace graphite in lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

It has also been demonstrated clearly that these trapping centers are the Si-{NCs.} However, in order to enhance the memory performances (i.e. charge retention and endurance to cycling), the synthesis of the Si-{NCs} must be carefully tuned, especially by adjusting the annealing conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate both that the Si-{NCs} are still responsible for the charge trapping while transistors are fabricated with strong {NCs} annealing conditions and that some memory performances recommended by the {ITRS}, more specifically the endurance criteria, are satisfied, with more than 10(6) erase/write cycles without degradation of the memory window.

Our analysis implicates a correlated structural-transport approach.

The electronic transport experiments in variable temperature, fitted with a theoretical extended-Glazman-Matveev model, address different levels of the tunneling mechanisms from direct to multi-center hopping. We demonstrate a double impact of dislocations, as extended defects, on the tunneling polarization. Firstly, the breaking of the crystal symmetry destroys the longitudinal and lateral coherence of the propagating Bloch functions. This affects the symmetry filtering efficiency of the Delta(1) states across the (001) {MgO} barriers and reduces the associated effective tunneling polarization. Secondly, dislocations provide localized states within the {MgO} gap. This determines temperature activated spin-conserving inelastic tunneling through chains of defects which are responsible for the one order of magnitude drop of the tunnel magnetoresistance from low to room temperature.

The presence of nanoscale materials in {AACVD} process would significantly influence deposition mechanism and thus affect microstructure and properties of the nanocomposites. In the present work, inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide ({IF-WS2)} has been codeposited with {Cr2O3} coatings using {AACVD.} In order to understand the codeposition process for the nanocomposite coatings, chemical reactions of the precursor and the deposition mechanism have been studied. The correlation between microstructure of the nanocomposite coatings and the codeposition mechanism in the {AACVD} process has been investigated. The heterogeneous reaction on the surface of {IF-WS2} nanoparticles, before reaching the substrate surface, is the key feature of the codeposition in the {AACVD} process.

Cobalt {NRs} with a mean diameter of 15 nm were first synthesized by the polyol process and then heated to 300 degrees C in octadecene ({ODE)}, oleylamine ({OA)}, or mixtures of these two solvents. The surface and structural modifications of the Co {NRs} were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS)}, X-ray diffraction ({XRD)}, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy ({SEM} and {TEM).} A disordered carbon shell was formed at the cobalt rod surface, the thickness of which can be tuned from 5 to 25 nm by increasing the amount of oleylamine in the solvent mixture. This carbon shell partially reduced the native cobalt oxide observed at the surface of the {NRs} and drastically improved their temperature stability as inferred from in situ {XRD} study and {TEM.} The shape anisotropy and the crystallite anisotropy of the hcp phase are both preserved up to 400 degrees C for the carbon-coated cobalt rods, whereas the uncoated {NRs} lose their anisotropy at 225 degrees C. Treatments at 300 C in {ODE/OA} mixtures for different durations allowed the progressive carburization of Co to {Co2C.} The crystallographic orientation of the {Co2C} grains within the cobalt {NRs} combined with the different carbon-shell thickness on the \{10 (1) over bar0\} and (0001) facets of the rods suggested a preferential carburization from the lateral facets of the hcp cobalt rods.},

In this work, we show that superstructures fabricated using the convective assisted capillary force assembly method ({CA-CFA)} and excited at that wavelength display a subwavelength patterning of their optical field intensity that results from the self-consistent coupling between the colloidal nanoparticles. First, we demonstrate the fabrication of shape-controlled three-dimensional assemblies of metallic nanocrystals using the {CA-CFA} method. In a second step, the absorption band resulting from the mutual coupling between the metallic building blocks is exploited to excite a coupled plasmon mode and map the twopphoton luminescence ({TPL)} by scanning a tightly focused light beam. Highly resolved {TPL} images show that the morphology of the plasmonic particle assemblies has a strong impact on their optical response. A model based on a rigorous optical Gaussian beam implementation inside a generalized propagator derived from a three-dimensional Green dyadic function accurately reproduces the {TPL} maps revealing the influence of interparticle separation and thus coupling between the individual particles. Finally, we show that the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity can be controlled by tuning the linear polarization of the optical excitation.},

We show that the photoluminescence of a single plane of silicon nanocrystals in silica, positioned at about 3 nm below the surface, can be enhanced by a factor of 2 to 3 in the presence of a silicon nanowire antenna on the silica surface. This could be the basis of a promising fully complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible process to improve silicon-based light emitting devices, despite a lower enhancement compared to plasmonic nanostructures. Two-dimensional photoluminescence maps recorded for different polarization configurations (incident electric field parallel or perpendicular to the nanowire axis) exhibit different behaviors and can be related to the electric field intensity distribution in the near-field region of the nanowire, where the active silicon nanocrystal layer is located.},

Using the analytical Lorenz-Mie theory, we compute both the absorption and scattering efficiencies, with a particular attention devoted to the shell thickness influence. The leaky modes resonances, associated to the optical response enhancement, are investigated and compared for all core/sheath and alloy variants. The optical resonances are found to keep almost the same spectral positions regardless the nanowire structure. More interestingly, core-sheath nanowires absorb more efficiently visible to near-infrared light than Si1-{xGex} alloys. Finally, the integrated solar absorption J(solar), which is a figure of merit proportional to the photocurrent generated in a nanowire, is more efficient in the case of {Ge/Si} core-sheath nanowires than in the two other structures.

Their properties were investigated by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry, Fourier infrared transmission spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence ({PL)} methods versus deposition conditions, annealing treatment, and superlattice design (doping and thickness of alternated sublayers). An intense Nd3+ emission from as-deposited single layers and superlattices was observed. The lower annealing temperature (below 900 degrees C) of the single layers and superlattices favors the formation of amorphous Si clusters that act as effective sensitizers of rare-earth ions. The highest Nd3+ {PL} intensity was achieved after a conventional annealing at about 600-800 degrees C in nitrogen flow for all samples. Crystallized Si-nanoclusters were formed in Si-rich-{SiO2} single layers upon annealing at 1000-1100 degrees C, whereas their formation in the superlattices occurred at higher temperatures (1100-1150 degrees C).

Above the Coulomb blockade threshold voltage and at high temperature, the charge transport evolves into a sequential tunneling regime between the nearestnanowires. Our analysis shows that the effective length of the Au-{NWs} inside the bundle is similar to the {1D} localisation length of the electronic wave function (of the order of 120 nm +/- 20 nm), but almost two orders of magnitude larger than the diameter of the nanowire.

The detailed lattice structure including the relevant electromechanical coupling mechanisms in close vicinity of the edge dislocations is, however, not well-understood, which hampers device optimization. Here, we investigate edge dislocations in ferroelectric {BiFeO3} by means of spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, a dedicated model-based structure analysis, and phase field simulations. Unit-cell-wise resolved strain and polarization profiles around edge dislocation reveal a wealth of material states including polymorph nanodomains and multiple domain walls characteristically pinned to the dislocation.

When surface plasmon and surface phonon frequencies match, the optical-resonances exhibit a large Rabi splitting typical of strongly interacting two-level systems. Based on numerical simulations of the electric near-field maps, we investigate the nature of the plaphonic excitations. In particular, we point out a strong local field enhancement boosted by the phononic surface. This effect is interpreted in terms of light harvesting by the plasmonic antenna from the phononic surface.

	abstract = {In situ transmission electron microscopy ({TEM)} is a really rich topic and is still viewed as a non-traditional microscopy, as it involves a lot of different processes. This chapter gives some explanations about in situ {TEM} mostly dedicated to the study of devices. It lists the various forms of in situ {TEM} techniques regarding their physical meaning conjugated to their experimental requirements. The forms of in situ {TEM} techniques include temperature control and electron irradiation, electromagnetic field applications, mechanical traction or compression, chemistry, light interaction, and current injection constraint. The chapter reviews commercial and homemade sample holder designs such as multi-contact holders and movable contact holders. The chapter finally describes some of the most common tools that can be used to easily design a {TEM} sample that can be fitted within the sample holders. The tools discussed are focused ion beam and {TEM} windows.},

These spectro-microscopy measurements were complemented by Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction spot analyses to gain insights into possible differences in manufacturing technology. Our results indicate that the two vessels underwent significantly different firing protocols, suggesting that there was a surprisingly quick evolution of a complex technological process in response to changing needs and tastes of a burgeoning empire. Furthermore, our results show that the ability of the full field X-ray spectro-microscope to investigate large sample areas (from hundreds of mu m(2) to as much as 2 mu m(2)) with high spatial resolution (of 300 nm down to 30 nm) together with its ability to correlate sample porosity (derived from tomography) with the distribution of chemical phases makes it an invaluable tool in the investigation of nanoscale processes in hierarchically heterogeneous chemical systems-from Roman ceramics to some of the most advanced technological products of today.},

	abstract = {In this work, we report on the synthesis of hybrid Au-{Fe3O4} nanoparticles ({NPs)} using a novel one-pot synthesis method that makes use of triethylene glycol as a solvent, a reducing agent, and a stabilizing layer. The produced nanoparticles consist of Au cores decorated with magnetite {Fe3O4} nanoparticles. Optical absorption measurements combined with numerical simulations showed that the Au-{Fe3O4} nanoparticles exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance clearly red-shifted with respect to that of bare Au nanopartides. This strong plasmonic resonance is exploited to produce surface-enhanced Raman scattering ({SERS)} from both the organic molecules and the iron oxide surrounding the Au cores. We found that the {SERS} signal exhibits strong temporal fluctuations which are used to identify the origin of the observed Raman lines. In particular, we clearly point out the presence of an iron hydroxide (gamma-{FeOOH)} layer at the surface of the {Fe3O4} nanopartides forming the shell. This result is supported by numerical simulations of the plasmonic near field generated by the Raman probe. Moreover, we investigate the light-induced phase transition from magnetite to hematite (alpha-{Fe2O3).} Owing to the strong {SERS} effect we were able to detect the formation of diiron-oxo bonds during the phase transition. These bonds are ascribed to the presence of a mixed magnetite/maghemite phase. We thus propose a new scheme where the phase transition is triggered by the iron hydroxide surface layer. Such a transition is here studied for the first time in Au-{Fe3O4} hybrid nanoparticles where the gold cores act as plasmonic nanoheaters responsible for the thermally induced phase transition.},

Moreover, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the microbial cells were wrapped or entrapped by carbon nanotube networks.

Silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) have been used as the active material to process, due to its interesting electrical and optical properties for electronic and photonic applications. This material has been fabricated in the form of well-defined arrays over a macroscopic surface, either by electron beam deposition or by ion beam synthesis. A further, crucial step toward the fabrication of the active area of the device is the formation of Si nanoparticle arrays onto sub-micrometric trenches defined by graphoepitaxy.

For this purpose, new hybrid pyrazole derived ligands containing alkylether, alkylthioether or alkylamino moieties have been synthesized and used to form Pd({II)} complexes and to stabilize Pd nanoparticles (Pd {NPs).} With the aim of studying the coordination mode of the ligands and further to understand their role in catalysis, both types of Pd species were characterized by appropriate techniques. In C-C coupling reactions promoted by different Pd colloidal systems, several reports evidenced that active species are molecular catalysts leached from Pd {NPs.} The most important feature of this work relies on the differences observed in the output of C-C coupling reactions, depending on the colloidal or molecular nature of the catalyst employed. Thus, molecular systems carry out typical Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, together with the dehalogenation of the substrate in different proportions. In contrast, Pd {NPs} catalyze either Suzuki-Miyaura or C-C homocoupling reactions depending on the haloderivative used. Interestingly, Pd {NPs} catalyze the quantitative dehalogenation of 4-iodotoluene. Differences observed in the chemoselectivity of these two catalytic systems support that reactions carried out with Pd {NPs} stabilized with the hybrid pyrazole ligands employed here take place on the surface of the colloids.},

The uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is constant for all film thicknesses. For two unit cell thick films, the easy magnetization axis changes from in-plane to perpendicular to the plane direction. Such a reorientation takes place as a result of the competition of constant uniaxial perpendicular anisotropy with weakening film magnetization. (C) 2013 Elsevier {BY.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We used ion implantation of H and He in Si and thermal treatments to produce two systems allowing to study the effects of global and local mechanical stress fields on the formation energy of H-precipitates called H-platelets. In the first part of the work, the depth-distribution of different crystallographic orientations of the precipitates formed along the implanted layer was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The global strain in the region was measured by X-ray diffraction, and the depth distribution of strain was reconstructed using a dynamical-theory-based code. Elasticity theory was used to develop a model based on mechanical interactions, explaining the preferential presence of (001)-oriented precipitates in the more stressed region of the implanted layer. In a second part, local sources of stress of nanometer size and cylindrical symmetry were introduced in a deeper region of the matrix, before the nucleation of H-platelets. The local stresses were embodied by (001) He-plate precipitates. Upon annealing, a specific arrangement of crystallographic variants of \{111\}-oriented H-platelets in a four-fold configuration was observed. To explain these experimental observations, and to calculate the variations of the formation energy of the precipitates under the presence of local stress tensors components, analytical and numerical (finite element method) approaches were used to develop {2D} and {3D} models based on elasticity theory. The concepts and modeling strategy developed here paves the way for determining the required conditions to create controlled architecture of precipitates at the nanoscale using local stress engineering.

	abstract = {Heat treatment of lithic raw material is known from the Middle Stone Age to the Neolithic. These findings require archaeometric techniques and methods for detecting the heat-induced effects within lithic artefacts. However, the existing methods are often cost-intensive and time-consuming, and most of them are destructive. Here, we present a new method using the infrared spectroscopic measurement of the strength of H-bonds formed between surface silanole groups ({SiOH)} and {H2O} molecules held in open pores of the samples. The reduction of H-bond strength in chalcedony is shown to be strongly correlated with the loss of open pores induced by heat treatment. Hence, the method is based on measuring one of the transformations aimed for by the instigators of the heat treatment: the reduction of porosity that modifies the rock's mechanical properties. A first application to heat-treated material from the Neolithic Chassey culture (southern France) shows that flint was heated to temperatures between 200 degrees C and 250 degrees C in this period. This has important implications for the study of the procedures used and the heating environments. Our new method is non-destructive, rapid, cost-effective and allows for detection of the used annealing temperatures.},

	abstract = {The quantitative determination of moganite in flint and chert plays an important role in the characterisation of these silica rocks and in the study of their genesis and evolution. Both Raman and infrared ({IR)} spectroscopy promise to be rapid and cost-effective tools for such studies. However, the use of vibrational spectra of moganite in silica rocks is hampered by the proximity of specific moganite bands with {IR} and Raman vibrations bands of non-bridging Si-O in silanol ({SiOH)} groups of chalcedony, the main coexisting silica phase. This may result in spectral interferences that lead to an overestimation of the moganite concentration. In order to calibrate quantitative moganite detection using {IR} and Raman spectroscopy, the spectra of chalcedony/moganite mixtures were studied using spectral decomposition. Heat treatment of the samples prior to their analysis is found to reduce the contribution of chalcedony silanol-bands to the measurement of the moganite bands, facilitating in this way the interpretation of the spectra. A new calibration curve is proposed for quantitative moganite detection using Raman spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy is also found to be useful for moganite quantification: a molar absorption coefficient of 43 L/mol.cm for the specific moganite-band at 575 cm(-1) is derived for the first time. The exact position of the specific {IR} and Raman moganite-bands is found to depend on whether the mineral occurs intermixed with chalcedony or in pure form. This study opens new prospects for quantitative moganite detection in silica rocks using vibrational spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {The thermal behaviour of silica rocks upon heat treatment is dependent on the constituent minerals and petrographic texture types. These constituents can be shown to be mainly quartz in the form of two types of chalcedony (Length-fast ({LF)} chalcedony and Length-slow ({LS)} chalcedony, the latter also being termed quartzine) and moganite. Even though the thermal behaviour of {LF-chalcedony} is well understood, major uncertainties persist concerning the high-temperature behaviour of {LS-chalcedony} and moganite. We present here a comparative study of these three constituents of common silica rocks. Our results show that the chemical reaction is the same in all three, Si-{OH} + {HO-Si} -{\textgreater} Si-O-Si + {H2O}, but that the reaction kinetics and activation temperatures are very different. {LS-chalcedony} begins to react from 200 A degrees C upwards, that is at temperatures 50 A degrees C below the ones observed in {LF-chalcedony}, and shows the fastest reaction kinetics of this 'water' loss. Chemically bound water ({SiOH)} in moganite is more stable at high temperatures and no specific activation temperature is necessary for triggering the temperature-induced 'water' loss. Moganite is also found to act as a stabilizer in silica rocks preventing them from temperature-induced fracturing. These findings have implications for the study of potential heat treatment temperatures of silica rocks (in industry and heritage studies), but they also shed light on the different structures of {SiO2} minerals and the role of {OH} impurities therein.},

In addition, interest of the scientific community for these {1D} nano-systems is also related to the new fundamental questions opened by their strongly anisotropic geometry, and to their potential as possible building blocks for future nano-electronic devices. In this context, Raman spectroscopy has been increasingly used to study nitride {NWs} and several new phenomena have been reported to date with respect to these one-dimensional structures. In this work, both {GaN} and {AlGaN} nanowires grown by plasma-assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy ({MBE)} have been experimentally investigated by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Experimental results are analyzed and compared to theoretical ones obtained by dielectric models and Discrete Dipole Approximation ({DDA)} method. Evidence is given for original surface effects in the optical phonon physics related to both structural anisotropy of the material and {1D} geometry of the {GaN} {NWs.} By using {UV} resonant excitation for {AlGaN} {NWs} in the whole range of composition, we demonstrate the selective excitation of {AlGaN} with the Al composition matching the energy of the exciting photons.

	abstract = {The setup of colloidal hybrid nanosystems based on biomimetic calcium phosphate apatites doped with europium ions has recently raised great interest in the pharmacological community, especially due to their bio-inspired character. This is especially relevant in relation with medical imaging for cancer diagnosis. Questions however remain in relation to a number of applicability aspects, some of which have been examined in this contribution. In a first part of this work, we explored further the luminescence properties of such colloidal nanoparticles. We pointed out, upon excitation of europium, the existence of some non-radiative de-excitation via the vibration of O-H oscillators located at the vicinity of the Eu3+ luminescent centers. The replacement of Eu3+ by Tb3+ ions, less prone to non-radiative de-excitation, was then tested in a preliminary way and can be seen as a promising alternative. In a second part of this work, we inspected the possibility to store these colloids in a dry state while retaining a re-suspension ability preserving the nanometer size of the initial nanoparticles, and we propose a functional protocol involving the addition of glucose prior to freeze-drying. We finally showed for the first time, based on titrations of intracellular Ca2+ and Eu3+ ions, that folic acid-functionalized biomimetic apatite nanoparticles were able to target cancer cells that overexpress folate receptors on their membrane, which we point out here in the case of T-47-D breast carcinoma cells, as opposed to {ZR-75-1} cells that do not express folate receptors. This contribution thus opens new exciting perspectives in the field of targeted cancer diagnosis, thus confirming the promise of biomimetic apatites-based colloidal formulations.},

	abstract = {H implantation results in the appearance of tensile out-of-plane strain in the implanted region which evolves during further annealing. {VnHm} complexes and/or larger platelets, both co-precipitates of vacancies and H atoms, are believed to be responsible for strain generation. However, during H+ implantation, Frenkel pairs i.e., both vacancies and interstitials are generated. Silicon self-interstitials have been rarely detected and thus their possible role in strain generation has been ignored so far. In this work, we demonstrate that Si interstitials are actually present in large measurable quantities in such implanted layers. For this, we have studied by Secondary Ions Mass Spectrometry the diffusion of boron delta layers during annealing at 350 {°C}, 550 {°C} and 850 {°C} after H implantation at 12 {keV} with a fluence of 1 × 1016 H+/cm2. The Si self-interstitial supersaturations were extracted by comparison with simulations. Frank dislocation loops, i.e., precipitates of Si atoms, were observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy growing by Ostwald ripening during 850 {°C} annealing. The supersaturation of Si self-interstitials in dynamical equilibrium with these loops was extracted showing consistency with the values found from the diffusion experiments. These results and more generally the role of interstitials in the strain build up are discussed.},

The broadening of the reciprocal space maps along the surface normal and the rotation of the intensity distribution ellipse is attributed to misfit dislocations at the interface.

The Selected Area ({SA)} diffraction mode yields valuable data regarding the textural arrangement of the graphene stacks. Specifically, the 002 arcs Opening Angle ({OA)} quantifies the degree of twist disorientation of the layers, and thus the material anisotropy. Depending on the {SA} aperture size, regions of interest from typically 0.01 to 10 mu m(2) can be probed. This work aims to improve on existing methodologies and develop image analysis software tools designed for digital imaging. For easier use, maintenance and portability, these tools are based on the Python programming language. Briefly, the azimuthal intensity profile of the 002 diffraction ring is extracted and fitted by a model based on Gaussian functions, while a fit of the average radial profile provides the offset constant. We show that this single algorithm works for values of {OA} ranging from less than 25 degrees up to similar to 180 degrees.

	frontal areas of behaving monkeys. 2. Spatiotemporal firing patterns
	were revealed by a method that detects all excessively repeating
	patterns regardless of their complexity or single-unit composition.
	3. Excess of repeating patterns was found in 30-60% of the cases
	examined when timing jitter of 1-3 ms was allowed. 4. An independent
	test refuted the hypothesis that these patterns represented chance
	events. 5. In a given behavioral condition there were usually many
	different patterns, each repeating several times, and not one (or
	a few) pattern repeating many times. 6. In 13 out of 20 cases, when
	a single unit elevated its firing rate in association with an external
	event beyond 40/s, most of the spikes within that period were associated
	with excessively repeating spatiotemporal patterns. 7. Of 157 types
	of patterns whose excess was most marked, 107 were composed of spikes
	from one single unit, 45 of the patterns contained spikes from two
	single units, and only one was composed of spikes from three different
	single units. 8. These properties suggest that the patterns were
	generated by reverberations in a synfire mode within self-exciting
	cell assemblies.}

  abstract = {The occipital lobes were obtained after death from six adult subjects

	oxidase (CO) to reveal metabolic activity in the primary (V1) and
	secondary (V2) visual cortices. Mean V1 surface area was 2643 mm2
	(range, 1986-3477 mm2). Ocular dominance columns were present in
	all cases, having a mean width of 863 microm. There were 78-126 column
	pairs along the V1 perimeter. Human column patterns were highly variable,
	but in at least one person they resembled a scaled-up version of
	macaque columns. CO patches in the upper layers were centered on
	ocular dominance columns in layer 4C, with one exception. In this
	individual, the columns in a local area resembled those present in
	the squirrel monkey, and no evidence was found for column/patch alignment.
	In every subject, the blind spot of the contralateral eye was conspicuous
	as an oval region without ocular dominance columns. It provided a
	precise landmark for delineating the central 15 degrees of the visual
	field. A mean of 53.1% of striate cortex was devoted to the representation
	of the central 15 degrees. This fraction was less than the proportion
	of striate cortex allocated to the representation of the central
	15 degrees in the macaque. Within the central 15 degrees, each eye
	occupied an equal territory. Beyond this eccentricity, the contralateral
	eye predominated, occupying 63% of the cortex. In one subject, monocular
	visual loss began at age 4 months, causing shrinkage of ocular dominance
	columns. In V2, which had a larger surface area than V1, CO stripes
	were present but could not be classified as thick or thin.}

	are stable macromolecular complexes of the ion pore-forming subunits
	with calmodulin, which serves as the intrinsic Ca(2+) gating subunit,
	as well as with protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A, which
	modulate Ca(2+) sensitivity. Well-known for their roles in regulating
	somatic excitability in central neurons, SK channels are also expressed
	in the postsynaptic membrane of glutamatergic synapses, where their
	activation and regulated trafficking modulate synaptic transmission
	and the induction and expression of synaptic plasticity, thereby
	affecting learning and memory. In this review we discuss the molecular
	and functional properties of SK channels and their physiological
	roles in central neurons.},

	Cognitive processes including selective attention may depend on synchronous
	activity of neurons at the gamma-band (around 40Hz). To determine
	the effect of neuroleptic challenge on transient auditory evoked
	40-Hz response, simultaneous measurement of 122-channel magnetoencephalogram
	(MEG) and 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was used. Either
	2mg of dopamine D(2)-receptor antagonist haloperidol or a placebo
	was administered orally to 11healthy subjects in a double-blind randomized
	crossover design in two separate sessions. The subjects attended
	to tones presented to one ear and ignored those presented to the
	other ear. Haloperidol significantly suppressed the transient 40-Hz
	electric response to the attended stimuli, while no significant effect
	was observed in the electric responses to the unattended tones or
	in the magnetic responses. The present result suggests that dopamine
	D(2) receptors modulate selective attention}

  abstract = { Transmission at individual synaptic contacts on CA1 hippocampal pyramidal
	neurons has been found to be very unreliable, with greater than half
	of the arriving presynaptic nerve impulses failing to evoke a postsynaptic
	response. This conclusion has been reached using the method of minimal
	stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and whole cell recording in hippocampal
	slices; with minimal stimulation only one or a few synapses are activated
	on the target neuron and the behavior of individual synapses tan
	be examined. Four sources for the unreliability of synaptic transmission
	have been investigated: (i) the fluctuation of axon thresholds at
	the site of stimulation causing the failure to generate a nerve impulse
	in the appropriate Schaffer collaterals, (ii) the failure of nerve
	impulses generated at the site of stimulation to arrive at the synapse
	because of conduction failures at axon branch points, (iii) an artifactual
	synaptic unreliability due to performing experiments in vitro at
	temperatures well below the normal mammalian body temperature, and
	(iv) transmission failures due to probabilistic release mechanisms
	at synapses with a very low capacity to release transmitter. We eliminate
	the first three causes as significant contributions and conclude
	that probabilistic release mechanisms at tow capacity synapses are
	the main cause of unreliability of synaptic transmission.},

  abstract = {Extracellular discharges were recorded from 205 neurons in the secondary
	somatosensory (SII) cortex of isoflurane-anesthetized cats. Cross-correlation
	analysis was used to characterize the temporal coordination of SII
	neurons recorded during cutaneous stimulation with a focal air jet
	that moved back-and-forth across the distal forelimb. Over two-thirds
	of the recorded neuron pairs ( n=357) displayed significant levels
	of synchronized activity during one or both directions of air-jet
	movement. The probability of detecting correlated activity varied
	according to the distance separating the neurons. Whereas synchronized
	responses were observed in 82.3% of the pairs in which the neurons
	were separated by 200-300 micro m, the incidence of synchronization
	declined to 52.3% for neurons that were separated by 600-800 micro
	m. The distance between neurons also had a significant effect on
	the temporal precision of correlated activity. For neurons that were
	separated by 200-300 micro m, synchronized responses in the cross-correlograms
	(CCGs) were characterized by narrow (0.5-1.0 ms) peaks at time zero.
	For SII neurons that were more widely separated, the peak half-widths
	were substantially broader and more likely to be displaced from time
	zero. Analysis of directional sensitivity indicated that only 14.2%
	of the correlated neurons displayed a directional preference for
	synchronized activity. By comparison, 63.4% of the neurons displayed
	a directional preference in their discharge rate. These results indicate
	that stimulus-induced synchronization is a prominent feature among
	local populations of SII neurons, but synchronization does not appear
	to play a critical role in coding the direction of stimulus movement.
	A comparison of these results with those obtained from similar experiments
	conducted in primary somatosensory (SI) cortex indicates that neuronal
	synchronization is more likely in SII cortex. This finding is discussed
	with respect to the known functional differences between the SI and
	SII cortical areas.},

  abstract = {Simple cells within layer IV of the cat primary visual cortex are
	selective for lines of a specific orientation. It has been proposed
	that their receptive-field properties are established by the pattern
	of connections that they receive from the lateral geniculate nucleus
	(LGN) of the thalamus. Thalamic inputs, however, represent only a
	small proportion of the synapses made onto simple cells, and others
	have argued that corticocortical connections are likely to be important
	in shaping simple-cell response properties. Here we describe a mechanism
	that might be involved in selectively strengthening the effect of
	thalamic inputs. We show that neighbouring geniculate neurons with
	overlapping receptive fields of the same type (on-centre or off-centre)
	often fire spikes that are synchronized to within 1 millisecond.
	Moreover, these neurons often project to a common cortical target
	neuron where synchronous spikes are more effective in evoking a postsynaptic
	response. We propose that precisely correlated firing within a group
	of geniculate neurons could serve to reinforce the thalamic input
	to cortical simple cells.},

	area that combines information from different sensory modalities
	to form a cognitive representation of space. However, until recently
	little has been known about the neural mechanisms responsible for
	this important cognitive process. Recent experiments from the author's
	laboratory indicate that visual, somatosensory, auditory and vestibular
	signals are combined in areas LIP and 7a of the posterior parietal
	cortex. The integration of these signals can represent the locations
	of stimuli with respect to the observer and within the environment.
	Area MSTd combines visual motion signals, similar to those generated
	during an observer's movement through the environment, with eye-movement
	and vestibular signals. This integration appears to play a role in
	specifying the path on which the observer is moving. All three cortical
	areas combine different modalities into common spatial frames by
	using a gain-field mechanism. The spatial representations in areas
	LIP and 7a appear to be important for specifying the locations of
	targets for actions such as eye movements or reaching; the spatial
	representation within area MSTd appears to be important for navigation
	and the perceptual stability of motion signals.},

	enhance their detection. Here we consider that a critical function
	of the human amygdala is to enhance the perception of stimuli that

	for normal perceptual awareness-that is, the attentional blink-we
	show that healthy observers demonstrate robust benefits for the perception
	of verbal stimuli of aversive content compared with stimuli of neutral
	content. In contrast, a patient with bilateral amygdala damage has
	no enhanced perception for such aversive stimulus events. Examination
	of patients with either left or right amygdala resections shows that
	the enhanced perception of aversive words depends specifically on
	the left amygdala. All patients comprehend normally the affective
	meaning of the stimulus events, despite the lack of evidence for
	enhanced perceptual encoding of these events in patients with left
	amygdala lesions. Our results reveal a neural substrate for affective
	influences on perception, indicating that similar neural mechanisms
	may underlie the affective modulation of both recollective and perceptual

  abstract = {Response to a stimulus is faster when a subject is attending and knows
	beforehand how to respond. It has been suggested recently that this
	occurs because ongoing neuronal activity is spatially and temporally
	structured during states of expectancy preceding a stimulus. This
	mechanism is believed to mediate top-down processing, facilitating
	the early grouping and selection of distributed neuronal ensembles
	implicated in ensuing sensory-motor processing. To validate this
	model, it must be shown that some features of this early ongoing
	neural activity are correlated with subsequent perceptual decisions
	or behavioral events. We investigated this hypothesis in an electrophysiologic
	study in 12 subjects carrying out a simple visuomotor reaction-time
	task. Local field potentials (LFP) at each brain voxel were estimated
	using a linear distributed inverse solution termed ELECTRA for each
	single trial of each subject. The energy of oscillations for different
	frequency bands was computed for the period between the warning cue
	and visual stimuli by applying a time-frequency decomposition to
	the estimated LFP. A nonparametric correlation coefficient was then
	calculated between energy of oscillations and reaction times for
	each single sweep. Gamma band oscillatory activity in a frontoparietal
	network before stimulus onset significantly correlated with reaction
	time for a significant amount of subjects. These results provide
	direct evidence for the role of neural oscillations as a top-down
	attentional control mechanism that mediates the speed of motor actions.

	tasks: tracking a moving visual target with a joystick-controlled
	cursor, threading pieces of tubing, and pinching the fingers sequentially

	and active extension of the wrist. For each site the spectral power
	of the ECoG during these behaviors was computed for 5 10 Hz ranges
	between 10 and 60 Hz. RESULTS: All subjects showed power decreases
	in the range of 11-20 Hz and power increases in the 31-60 Hz range
	during performance of the visuomotor tasks, at sites in forearm sensorimotor
	cortex and adjacent areas. Simple wrist movements often produced
	little change in power. Three subjects showed episodes of explicit
	gamma oscillations during the visuomotor tasks. Different sites showed
	increases in gamma-range power for different tasks, indicating that
	the spatial distribution of the gamma activity is specific to the
	tasks. Cross-spectra showed that gamma activity could become synchronized
	between separate sites during particular tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Synchronized
	gamma-range activity in human sensorimotor cortex increases with
	performance of manipulative visuomotor tasks, supporting the hypothesis
	that coherent gamma oscillations may play a role in sensorimotor
	integration or attention.}

  abstract = {Auditory event-related magnetic fields and electrical potentials were
	recorded from subjects who were instructed to attend to a sequence
	of constant pitch tones presented to one ear and ignore a concurrent
	sequence of tones with a different pitch presented to the other ear.
	Subjects' task was to detect and count longer duration 'target' tones
	(P = 0.1) interspersed with 'standard' tones (P = 0.4) in the attended
	ear and to ignore tones (both standards and targets) in the other
	ear. All stimuli both attended and ignored elicited a prominent response
	approximately 100 msec after tone onset (N1m). Beginning approximately
	150 msec following stimulus onset an attetion-dependent modulation
	of the magnetic response (Ndm) was observed for each subject. In
	2 subjects whose magnetic field patterns were mapped in detail, equivalent
	current dipole (ECD) modeling was used to estimate the sources of
	N1m and Ndm activity. By transforming the coordinate systems for
	magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and ECD solutions, the locations
	and orientations of ECDs were determined relative to each subject's
	brain structures. ECDs for both N1m and Ndm were located in auditory
	cortex along the posterior regions of the sylvian fissure. Monte
	Carlo error analyses indicated that the ECD for Ndm is near, but
	significantly anterior to that for N1m.},

  abstract = {Four experiments were conducted, to explore the notion of objects
	in perception. Taking as a starting point the effects of display
	content on rapid attention transfer and manipulating curvature, closure,
	and processing time, a link between objects of attention and objects
	of perception is proposed. In Experiment 1, a number of parallel,
	equally spaced, straight lines facilitated attention transfer along
	the lines, relative to transfer across the lines. In Experiment 2,
	with curved, closed-contour shapes, no 'same-object' facilitation
	was observed. However, when a longer time interval was provided,
	in Experiment 3, a same-object advantage started to emerge. In Experiment
	4, using the same curved shapes but in a non-speeded distance estimation
	task, a strong effect of objects was observed. It is argued that
	attention transfer is facilitated by line tracing but that line tracing
	is encouraged by objects.}

  abstract = { Department of Radiology, Maastricht University Hospital, P.O. Box
	5800, 6202 AZ, The, Maastricht, Netherlands. Objectives: The aim
	of this study was to localize and to investigate response properties
	of the primary (SI) and the secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex
	upon median nerve electrical stimulation. Methods: Functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to quantify brain activation under
	different paradigms using electrical median nerve stimulation in
	healthy right-handed volunteers. In total 11 subjects were studied
	using two different stimulus current values in the right hand: at
	motor threshold (I(max)) and at I(min) (1/2 I(max)). In 7 of these
	11 subjects a parametric study was then conducted using 4 stimulus
	intensities (6/6, 5/6, 4/6 and 3/6 I(max)). Finally, in 10 subjects
	an attention paradigm in which they had to perform a counting task
	during stimulation with I(min) was done. Results: SI activation increased
	with current amplitude. SI did not show significant activation during
	stimulation at I(min). SII activation did not depend on current amplitude.
	Also the posterior parietal cortex appeared to be activated at I(min).
	The I(min) response in SII significantly increased by selective attention
	compared to I(min) without attention. At I(max) significant SI activity
	was observed only in the contralateral hemisphere, the ipsilateral
	cerebellum, while other areas possibly showed bilateral activation.
	Conclusions: Distributed activation in the human somatosensory cortical
	system due to median nerve stimulation was observed using fMRI. SI,
	in contrast to SII, appears to be exclusively activated on the contralateral
	side of the stimulated hand at I(max), in agreement with the concept
	of SI's important role in processing of proprioceptive input. Only
	SII remains significantly activated in case of lower current values,
	which are likely to exclusively stimulate the sensible fibres mediating
	cutaneous receptor input. Selective attention only enhances SII activity,
	indicating a higher-order role for SII in the processing of somatosensory
	input.}

  abstract = {It is widely held that visual cortical neurons encode information
	primarily in their mean firing rates. Some proposals, however, emphasize
	the information potentially available in the temporal structure of
	spike trains (Optican and Richmond, 1987; Bialek et al., 1991), in
	particular with respect to stimulus-related synchronized oscillations
	in the 30-70 Hz range (Eckhorn et al., 1988; Gray et al., 1989; Kreiter
	and Singer, 1992) as well as via bursting cells (Cattaneo et al.,
	1981a; Bonds, 1992). We investigate the temporal fine structure of
	spike trains recorded in extrastriate area MT of the trained macaque
	monkey, a region that plays a major role in processing motion information.
	The data were recorded while the monkey performed a near-threshold
	direction discrimination task so that both physiological and psychophysical
	data could be obtained on the same set of trials (Britten et al.,
	1992). We identify bursting cells and quantify their properties,
	in particular in relation to the behavior of the animal. We compute
	the power spectrum and the distribution of interspike intervals (ISIs)
	associated with individual spike trains from 212 cells, averaging
	these quantities across similar trials. (1) About 33% of the cells
	have a relatively flat power spectrum with a dip at low temporal
	frequencies. We analytically derive the power spectrum of a Poisson
	process with refractory period and show that it matches the observed
	spectrum of these cells. (2) About 62% of the cells have a peak in
	the 20-60 Hz frequency band. In about 10% of all cells, this peak
	is at least twice the height of its base. The presence of such a
	peak strongly correlates with a tendency of the cell to respond in
	bursts, that is, two to four spikes within 2-8 msec. For 93% of cells,
	the shape of the power spectrum did not change dramatically with
	stimulus conditions. (3) Both the ISI distribution and the power
	spectrum of the vast majority of bursting cells are compatible with
	the notion that these cells fire Poisson-distributed bursts, with
	a burst-related refractory period. Thus, for our stimulus conditions,
	no explicitly oscillating neuronal process is required to yield a
	peak in the power spectrum. (4) We found no statistically significant
	relationship between the peak in the power spectrum and psychophysical
	measures of the monkeys' performance on the direction discrimination
	task. (5) For cells firing bursts, ROC (receiver operating characteristic)
	analysis shows that the ''event'' rate, where an event is either
	a single burst of spikes or an isolated spike, is on average a more
	sensitive measure of visual stimulus direction than the total number
	of spikes, used previously (Britten et al., 1992), implying that
	the number of spikes in a burst is less stimulus dependent than the
	overall firing rate or the rate of bursts.},

  year = {1999},
  volume = {128},
  pages = {109-17},
  abstract = {There is currently much interest in the synchronisation of neural
	discharge and the potential role it may play in information coding
	within the nervous system. We describe some recent results from investigations
	of synchronisation within the motor system. Local field potentials
	(LFPs) and identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) were recorded
	from the primary motor cortex of monkeys trained to perform a precision
	grip task. The LFPs showed bursts of oscillatory activity at 20-30
	Hz, which were coherent with the rectified electromyographs (EMG)
	of contralateral hand and forearm muscles. This oscillatory synchronisation
	showed a highly specific task dependence, being present only during
	the part of the task when the animal maintained a steady grip and
	not during the movement phases before or after it. PTNs were phase-locked
	to LFP oscillations, implying that at least part of the coherence
	between cortical activity and EMG was mediated by corticospinal fibres.
	The phase locking of the PTNs to LFP oscillations produced task-dependent
	oscillatory synchronisation between PTN pairs, as assessed by the
	single-unit cross-correlation histogram. Recordings were also made
	from normal human subjects performing a precision grip similar to
	that used in the monkey recordings. Pairs of EMGs recorded from intrinsic
	hand and forearm muscles showed 20-30 Hz coherence, which modulated
	during task performance, being present only during periods of steady
	contraction. We suggest that these changes in EMG-EMG synchronisation
	reflect changing levels of synchronous drive from the corticospinal
	system. The generation of oscillations in the cortex is discussed
	in the light of results from a model of local cortical circuits.
	Other modelling work has shown that synchrony in the corticospinal
	inputs could act to recruit motoneurones more efficiently, producing
	more output force from a muscle than asynchronous inputs firing at
	the same mean rate. A speculative hypothesis is presented on the
	role of synchronous oscillations in the motor system, which is consistent
	with experimental observations to date.}

  abstract = {1. Recordings were made of local field potential (slow waves) and
	pyramidal tract neurone (PTN) discharge from pairs of sites separated
	by a horizontal distance of up to 1.5 mm in the primary motor cortex
	of two conscious macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task.
	2. In both monkeys, the slow wave recordings showed bursts of oscillations
	in the 20-30 Hz range. Spectral analysis revealed that the oscillations
	were coherent between the two simultaneously recorded cortical sites.
	In the monkey from which most data were recorded, the mean frequency
	of peak coherence was 23.4 Hz. 3. Coherence in this frequency range
	was also seen between cortical slow wave recordings and rectified
	EMG of hand and forearm muscles active during the task, and between
	pairs of rectified EMGs. 4. The dynamics of the coherence were investigated
	by analysing short, quasi-stationary data segments aligned relative
	to task performance. This revealed that the 20-30 Hz coherent oscillations
	were present mainly during the hold phase of the precision grip task.
	5. The spikes of identified PTNs were used to compile spike-triggered
	averages of the slow wave recordings. Oscillations were seen in 11/17
	averages of the slow wave recorded on the same electrode as the triggering
	spike, and 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the distant
	electrode. The mean period of these oscillations was 45.8 ms. 6.
	It is concluded that oscillations in the range 20-30 Hz are present
	in monkey motor cortex, are coherent between spatially separated
	cortical sites, and encompass the pyramidal tract output neurones.
	They are discernable in the EMG of active muscles, and show a consistent

	WC1N 3BG, United Kingdom. snb11@cam.ac.uk Neural synchronization
	in the cortex, and its potential role in information coding, has
	attracted much recent attention. In this study, we have recorded
	long spike trains (mean, 33,000 spikes) simultaneously from multiple
	single neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of two conscious
	macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task. The task required
	the monkey to use its index finger and thumb to move two spring-loaded
	levers into a target, hold them there for 1 s, and release for a
	food reward. Synchrony was analyzed using a time-resolved cross-correlation
	method, normalized using an estimate of the instantaneous firing
	rate of the cell. This was shown to be more reliable than methods
	using trial-averaged firing rate. A total of 375 neurons was recorded
	from the M1 hand area; 235 were identified as pyramidal tract neurons.
	Synchrony was weak [mean k' = 1.05 +/- 0.04 (SD)] but widespread
	among pairs of M1 neurons (218/1359 pairs with above-chance synchrony),
	including output neurons. Synchrony usually took the form of a broad
	central peak [average width, 18.7 +/- 8.7 (SD) ms]. There were marked
	changes during different phases of the task. As a population, synchrony
	was greatest during the steady hold period in striking contrast to
	the averaged cell firing rate, which was maximal when the animal
	was moving the levers into target. However, the modulation of synchrony
	during task performance showed considerable variation across individual
	cell pairs. Two types of synchrony were identified: oscillatory (with
	periodic side lobes in the cross-correlation) and nonoscillatory.
	Their relative contributions were quantified by filtering the cross-correlations
	to exclude either frequencies from 18 to 37 Hz or all higher and
	lower frequencies. At the peak of population synchrony during the
	hold period, about half (51.7% in one monkey, 56.2% in the other)
	of the synchronization was within this oscillatory bandwidth. This
	study provides strong support for assemblies of neurons being synchronized
	during specific phases of a complex task with potentially important
	consequences for both information processing within M1 and for the
	impact of M1 commands on target motoneurons. },

	a Kanizsa-type square is facilitated when the target display is preceded
	by a 40-Hz flickering premask of 3 x 3 crosses, with four crosses
	synchronously oscillating at the subsequent target location. To examine
	whether this 'synchrony-priming' effect is influenced by, or dependent
	on, visuo-spatial attention, a spatial-cueing manipulation was introduced.
	Observers were presented with a visual or acoustic cue which indicated
	the likely target quadrant. The main finding was that synchrony priming
	was larger for invalidly, compared with validly, cued locations,
	and that the priming effect was figural, rather than spatial, in
	nature (i.e., confined to points associated with the completed boundary,
	rather than extending to the inner region, defined by the synchronous
	premask elements). This pattern of effects argues that target processing
	is expedited not by attracting spatial attention to the primed location,
	but by the prime expediting (figure-specific) target encoding, as
	a result of which the target position gains a processing and selection
	advantage relative to non-primed locations.}

	process was robust even under conditions of occlusion, although there

  abstract = {It has previously been suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities
	found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse,
	distributed representation of natural scenes, and it has been reasoned
	that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm
	that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features.
	We show here that a new unsupervised learning algorithm based on
	information maximization, a nonlinear "infomax" network, when applied
	to an ensemble of natural scenes produces sets of visual filters
	that are localized and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like
	and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximization network.
	In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible,
	since this infomax network performs Independent Components Analysis
	or ICA, for sparse (super-gaussian) component distributions. We compare
	the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with
	other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis
	(PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have
	more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They
	also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex,
	which suggests that these neurons form a natural, information-theoretic
	coordinate system for natural images. },

  abstract = {Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine and Biomedical
	Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo,
	New York 14214. Attentional modulation of neuronal responsiveness
	is common in many areas of visual cortex. We examined whether attentional
	modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that
	in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare
	attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas
	of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions
	of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar
	(Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early,
	intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM,
	area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three
	attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear
	(ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state),
	and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional
	modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus
	in a neuron's receptive field during each of the three states; the
	three responses defined a "response vector" whose deviation from
	the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal)
	indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation.
	Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the
	lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin.
	Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased
	from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character
	(as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation
	state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during
	fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured
	by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed
	as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain
	areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19-26%),
	and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial
	variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation,
	also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas
	accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude
	among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio
	of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability.
	The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant,
	1.3 +/- 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude
	that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly
	affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied
	and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic
	variability of response.},

	ideas put forth by Freeman and Johnson and results obtained by Looft.
	The principal development in the present model is its specification
	that RA receptor potentials are updated as a linear function of stimulus
	velocity above baseline; the model thus readily accommodates non-sinusoidal
	input. It also incorporates modifications to Freeman and Johnson's
	model proposed by Slavík and Bell, namely a period of refractoriness
	lasting 1 ms followed by a period of hyperexcitability lasting 13.5
	ms. The model is applied to various psychophysical and physiological
	situations: psychophysical threshold vs. frequency, RA afferent impulse
	rates vs. intensity, impulse regularity vs. frequency, phase retardation
	vs. frequency, and responses to non-repeating noise and to complex
	stimuli. Model output closely matches psychophysical and neurophysiological
	data. The proposed model thus reliably predicts RA afferent responses
	to arbitrary stimuli and may facilitate the development of theories
	relating psychophysical phenomena to their underlying neural representations.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of extended
	suprathreshold vibratory stimulation on the sensitivity of slowly
	adapting type 1 (SA1), rapidly adapting (RA), and Pacinian (PC) afferents.
	To that end, an algorithm was developed to track afferent absolute
	(I0) and entrainment (I1) thresholds as they change over time. We
	recorded afferent responses to periliminal vibratory test stimuli,
	which were interleaved with intense vibratory conditioning stimuli
	during the adaptation period of each experimental run. From these
	measurements, the algorithm allowed us to infer changes in the afferents'
	sensitivity. We investigated the stimulus parameters that affect
	adaptation by assessing the degree to which adaptation depends on
	the amplitude and frequency of the adapting stimulus. For all three
	afferent types, I0 and I1 increased with increasing adaptation frequency
	and amplitude. The degree of adaptation seems to be independent of
	the firing rate evoked in the afferent by the conditioning stimulus.
	In the analysis, we distinguished between additive adaptation (in
	which I0 and I1 shift equally) and multiplicative effects (in which
	the ratio I1/I0 remains constant). RA threshold shifts are almost
	perfectly additive. SA1 threshold shifts are close to additive and
	far from multiplicative (I1 threshold shifts are twice the I0 shifts).
	PC shifts are more difficult to classify. We used an integrate-and-fire
	model to study the possible neural mechanisms. A change in transducer
	gain predicts a multiplicative change in I0 and I1 and is thus ruled
	out as a mechanism underlying SA1 and RA adaptation. A change in
	the resting action potential threshold predicts equal, additive change
	in I0 and I1 and thus accounts well for RA adaptation. A change in
	the degree of refractoriness during the relative refractory period
	predicts an additional change in I1 such as that observed for SA1
	fibers. We infer that adaptation is caused by an increase in spiking
	thresholds produced by ion flow through transducer channels in the
	receptor membrane. In a companion paper, we describe the time-course
	of vibratory adaptation and recovery for SA1, RA, and PC fibers.},

	model of human visual attention. However, for electrophysiological
	recording in behaving animals simplified stimuli and controlled eye
	position are traditionally used. To validate monkeys as a model for
	human attention during realistic free viewing, we contrasted human
	(n = 5) and monkey (n = 5) gaze behavior using 115 natural and artificial
	video clips. Monkeys exhibited broader ranges of saccadic endpoints
	and amplitudes and showed differences in fixation and intersaccadic
	intervals. We compared tendencies of both species to gaze toward
	scene elements with similar low-level visual attributes using two
	computational models�luminance contrast and saliency. Saliency was
	more predictive of both human and monkey gaze, predicting human saccades
	better than monkey saccades overall. Quantifying interobserver gaze
	consistency revealed that while humans were highly consistent, monkeys
	were more heterogeneous and were best predicted by the saliency model.
	To address these discrepancies, we further analyzed high-interest
	gaze targets�those locations simultaneously chosen by at least two
	monkeys. These were on average very similar to human gaze targets,
	both in terms of specific locations and saliency values. Although
	substantial quantitative differences were revealed, strong similarities
	existed between both species, especially when focusing analysis onto
	high-interest targets.},

  abstract = {Monkeys are widely used as animal models for human visual attention,
	however, they are usually studied using simplified stimulus conditions
	in order to have experimental control for neural recording. Here
	we compared the visual behavior of 5 human and 5 monkey observers
	to determine the degree that the two species show bottom-up differences
	in visual behavior. To this end we recording eye movements of na�ve
	observers in a free-viewing task using 115 video clips (47,903 frames,
	approximately 27 minutes) ranging in semantic content (natural scenes,
	monkey relevant, noise etc). Saccade and fixation statistics such
	as the main sequence, saccadic endpoint distribution and frequency
	of saccades indicate a strong difference between human and monkey
	eye movements. To test whether these difference affect overall visual
	behavior and to establish to what extent human and rhesus monkey
	eye movements can be predicted by bottom-up stimulus properties we
	quantified primate gaze shifts using a model of visual attention,
	Surprise Model (Itti and Baldi '06). We also compared a given subjects
	gaze to the gaze locations of all other subjects on the same stimulus(Interobserver
	model), which includes bottom-up and top-down factors. A computational
	model of visual attention predicted human gaze shifts marginally,
	but significantly better than monkey gaze shifts(p < 0.001). However,
	when looking at individual video clips the correlation between measured
	Surprise at human and monkey saccadic endpoints is high (r2 = 0.62,
	p < 10-9). Furthermore, locations that 3 monkeys looked at simultaneously
	were higher in Surprise than those locations that multiple humans
	agreed to look (p < 0.07). The computational model predicted monkey
	eye movements better than the monkey interobserver model (p < 0.002),
	yet the interobserver model predicted human gaze shifts far better
	than the computational model (p < .001). In whole the results demonstrate
	that although there are some differences in visual behavior between
	species, monkeys can be effectively used as a model for stimulus
	driven attention in humans during free viewing tasks.},

  abstract = { Although several studies have shown modulation of neural activity
	with attention in area V4 of animals with fixed gaze, the mechanisms
	underlying active exploration of the environment with freely moving
	attention and gaze remain unclear. We investigated the neural mechanisms
	of goal-directed selection in area V4, in macaque monkeys freely
	scanning a visual search array to find a target defined by color,
	shape, or both features (i.e., conjunction). The monkey was shown
	a cue at the start of the trial, which indicated the features of
	the target to be found in the subsequently presented search array.
	After the target was found, the monkey was rewarded for fixating
	it for a prescribed duration. During the cue period, the coherence
	between spikes and the local field potential (LFP) activity was uniformly
	greater for conjunction cues compared to feature cues, and the coherence
	for all cues increased as a given cue was repeated over trials, in
	parallel with superior behavioral performance in both cases. After
	the search array appeared, the spike-field coherence throughout the
	trial was greater at all frequencies when the stimulus inside the
	receptive field matched the features of the searched-for target,
	even when that stimulus was not yet selected for a saccadic eye movement,
	suggesting a bias in favor of neurons representing the target features,
	which persisted until the target was found. Spike-field coherence
	was also further enhanced when the receptive field stimulus was the
	target of the saccade. Thus, the results suggest that the search
	for the target is accomplished by a parallel process, synchronizing
	the activity of neurons representing target features throughout the
	visual field, followed by a serial selection of neurons representing
	candidate targets.}

  abstract = {Tactile pattern recognition depends on form and texture perception.
	A principal dimension of texture perception is roughness, the neural
	coding of which was the focus of this study. Previous studies have
	shown that perceived roughness is not based on neural activity in
	the Pacinian or cutaneous slowly adapting type II (SAII) neural responses
	or on mean impulse rate or temporal patterning in the cutaneous slowly
	adapting type I (SAI) or rapidly adapting (RA) discharge evoked by
	a textured surface. However, those studies found very high correlations
	between roughness scaling by humans and measures of spatial variation
	in SAI and RA firing rates. The present study used textured surfaces
	composed of dots of varying height (280-620 micron) and diameter
	(0.25-2.5 mm) in psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments.
	RA responses were affected least by the range of dot diameters and
	heights that produced the widest variation in perceived roughness,
	and these responses could not account for the psychophysical data.
	In contrast, spatial variation in SAI impulse rate was correlated
	closely with perceived roughness over the whole stimulus range, and
	a single measure of SAI spatial variation accounts for the psychophysical
	data in this (0.974 correlation) and two previous studies. Analyses
	based on the possibility that perceived roughness depends on both
	afferent types suggest that if the RA response plays a role in roughness
	perception, it is one of mild inhibition. These data reinforce the
	hypothesis that SAI afferents are mainly responsible for information
	about form and texture whereas RA afferents are mainly responsible
	for information about flutter, slip, and motion across the skin surface.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments on cortical neural networks have revealed the existence
	of well-defined avalanches of electrical activity. Such avalanches
	have been claimed to be generically scale invariant—i.e. power law
	distributed—with many exciting implications in neuroscience. Recently,
	a self-organized model has been proposed by Levina, Herrmann and
	Geisel to explain this empirical finding. Given that (i) neural dynamics
	is dissipative and (ii) there is a loading mechanism progressively
	'charging' the background synaptic strength, this model/dynamics
	is very similar in spirit to forest-fire and earthquake models, archetypical
	examples of non-conserving self-organization, which have recently
	been shown to lack true criticality. Here we show that cortical neural
	networks obeying (i) and (ii) are not generically critical; unless
	parameters are fine-tuned, their dynamics is either subcritical or
	supercritical, even if the pseudo-critical region is relatively broad.
	This conclusion seems to be in agreement with the most recent experimental
	observations. The main implication of our work is that, if future
	experimental research on cortical networks were to support the observation
	that truly critical avalanches are the norm and not the exception,
	then one should look for more elaborate (adaptive/evolutionary) explanations,
	beyond simple self-organization, to account for this.}

  abstract = { Visual, auditory, and tactile reaction time (RT) signals were used
	in an a-reaction task. The main independent variable was the predictability
	of signal modality, which was varied by cuing the relevant modality
	or modalities before each trial. The response requirement was nondiscriminative
	with respect to modality. Three experiments showed that (a) RT's
	were longer when signal modality was uncertain, the more so with
	three possible modalities than with two; (b) this effect of uncertainty
	was approximately the same whether varied within subjects or between
	subjects; and (C) the effect of uncertainty was somewhat smaller
	on tactile RTs than on visual or auditory RTs. Experiment 4 examined
	change in this uncertainty effect with practice. The uncertainty
	effect declined over 11 daily sessions to the point of virtual absence
	from auditory and tactile RTs but was restored or increase will respect
	to all three signals following one session of discrimination RTs
	("respond if visual, refrain if auditory or tactile"). The results
	are interpreted as showing that attention can be allocated to sensory
	modalities and that the implied selective process is concerned with
	modality "identification," though not in a way consistent with a
	channel-switching model thereof.}

  journal = ebr,
  year = {1993},
  volume = {95},
  pages = {15-27},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {We examined neuronal activity in three parts of the primate frontal
	cortex: the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor cortex and a
	ventrolateral part of the dorsolateral prefrontal (PF) cortex. Two
	monkeys fixated a 0.2-degrees white square in the center of a video
	display while depressing a switch located between two touch pads.
	On each trial, a spatial-attentional/mnemonic (SAM) cue was presented
	first. The SAM cue consisted of one 2-degrees x 2-degrees square,
	usually red or green, and its location indicated where a conditional
	motor instruction would appear after a delay period. The stimulus
	event containing the motor instruction, termed the motor instructional/conditional
	(MIC) cue, could be of two general types. It might consist of a single
	2-degrees x 2-degrees square stimulus identical to one of the SAM
	cues presented at the same location as the SAM cue on that trial.
	When the MIC cue was a single square, it instructed the monkey to
	move its forelimb to one of the two touch pads according to the following
	conditional rule: a green MIC cue meant that contact with the right
	touch pad would be rewarded on that trial and a red MIC cue instructed
	a movement to the left touch pad. Alternatively, the MIC cue might
	consist of two 2-degrees x 2-degrees squares, only one of which was
	at the SAM-cue location: in those cases, one square was red and the
	other was green. The colored square at the SAM cue location for that
	trial was the instructing stimulus, and the other part of the MIC
	cue was irrelevant. When, after a variable delay period, the MIC
	cue disappeared, the monkey had to touch the appropriate target within
	1 s to receive a reward and could break visual fixation. The experimental
	design allowed comparison of frontal cortical activity when one stimulus,
	identical in retinocentric, craniocentric, and allocentric spatial
	location as well as all other stimulus parameters, had two different
	meanings for the animal's behavior. When a stimulus was the SAM cue,
	it led to either a reorientation of spatial attention to its location,
	or the storage of its location in spatial memory. By contrast, when
	it was the MIC cue, the same stimulus instructed a motor act to be
	executed after a delay period. For the majority of PMd neurons (55%),
	post-MIC cue activity exceeded post-SAM cue activity. In many instances,
	no activity followed the SAM cue, although the identical stimulus
	caused profound modulation when it served as the MIC cue. In PF,
	by contrast, significantly fewer cells (30%) showed such a property,
	and PMv was intermediate in this respect (36%). The results support
	the hypothesis that many PMd cells reflect the motor significance
	of stimuli, and that a significantly smaller proportion of cells
	in PF do so.},

	91125, USA. achim@klab.caltech.eduWe used a concurrent-task paradigm
	to investigate the attentional cost of simple visual tasks. As in
	earlier studies, we found that detecting a unique orientation in
	an array of oriented elements ("pop-out") carries little or no attentional
	cost. Surprisingly, this is true at all levels of performance and
	holds even when pop-out is barely discriminable. We discuss this
	finding in the context of our previous report that the attentional
	cost of stimulus detection is strongly influenced by the presence
	and nature of other stimuli in the display (Braun, 1994b). For discrimination
	tasks, we obtained a similarly mixed outcome: Discrimination of letter
	shape carried a high attentional cost whereas discrimination of color
	and orientation did not. Taken together, these findings lead us to
	modify our earlier position on the attentional costs of detection
	and discrimination tasks (Sagi & Julesz, 1985). We now believe that
	observers enjoy a significant degree of "ambient" visual awareness
	outside the focus of attention, permitting them to both detect and
	discriminate certain visual information. We hypothesize that the
	information in question is selected by a competition for saliency
	at the level of early vision.},

	location and appearance of other object parts. During several training
	sessions, observers studied an object against a blank background.
	They then viewed this object against a background of clutter that
	camouflaged some parts of the object while leaving other parts salient.
	The observer's task was to find the camouflaged part. We varied the
	symmetry of the salient part with the expectation that as this symmetry
	decreased, the information about the camouflaged part's location
	and appearance would increase and this would facilitate search. Our
	results suggest that observers can use the salient part to predict
	the location, but not the appearance, of the camouflaged part.}

	we show, using Granger causality measures on blood oxygen level-dependent
	time series, that frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus
	(IPS) activity predicts visual occipital activity before an expected
	visual stimulus. Top-down levels of Granger causality from FEF and
	IPS to visual occipital cortex were significantly greater than both
	bottom-up and mean cortex-wide levels in all individual subjects
	and the group. In the group and most individual subjects, Granger
	causality was significantly greater from FEF to IPS than from IPS
	to FEF, and significantly greater from both FEF and IPS to intermediate-tier
	than lower-tier ventral visual areas. Moreover, top-down Granger
	causality from right IPS to intermediate-tier areas was predictive
	of correct behavioral performance. These results suggest that FEF

	in relation to visual attention. The current approach may prove advantageous

	in spike train covariograms that may be very similar to those caused
	by spike timing synchronization (see companion article). Two quantitative
	methods are described here. The first is a method to estimate the
	excitability component of a covariogram, based on trial-by-trial
	estimates of excitability. Once estimated, this component may be
	subtracted from the covariogram, leaving only other types of contributions.
	The other is a method to determine whether the covariogram could
	potentially have been caused by latency covariations.}

  abstract = {A model of two lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells, which interact
	only through slow (tens of seconds) covariations in their resting
	membrane potentials, is used here to investigate the effect of such
	covariations on cross-correlograms taken during stimulus-driven conditions.
	Despite the slow timescale of the interactions, the model generates
	cross-correlograms with peak widths in the range of 25-200 ms. These
	bear a striking resemblance to those reported in studies of LGN cells
	by Sillito et al., which were taken at the time as evidence of a
	fast spike timing synchronization interaction; the model highlights
	the possibility that those correlogram peaks may have been caused
	by a mechanism other than spike synchronization. Slow resting potential
	covariations are suggested instead as the dominant generating mechanism.
	How can a slow interaction generate covariogram peaks with a width
	100-1,000 times thinner than its timescale? Broad peaks caused by
	slow interactions are modulated by the cells' poststimulus time histograms
	(PSTHs). When the PSTHs have thin peaks (e.g., tens of milliseconds),
	the cross-correlogram peaks generated by slow interactions will also
	be thin; such peaks are easily misinterpretable as being caused by
	fast interactions. Although this point is explored here in the context
	of LGN recordings, it is a general point and applies elsewhere. When
	cross-correlogram peak widths are of the same order of magnitude
	as PSTH peak widths, experiments designed to reveal short-timescale
	interactions must be interpreted with the issue of possible contributions
	from slower interactions in mind.},

  abstract = {The response of a neuron in the visual cortex to stimuli of different
	contrast placed in its receptive field is commonly characterized
	using the contrast response curve. When attention is directed into
	the receptive field of a V4 neuron, its contrast response curve is
	shifted to lower contrast values (Reynolds et al., 2000). The neuron
	will thus be able to respond to weaker stimuli than it responded
	to without attention. Attention also increases the coherence between
	neurons responding to the same stimulus (Fries et al., 2001). We
	studied how the firing rate and synchrony of a densely interconnected
	cortical network varied with contrast and how they were modulated
	by attention. The changes in contrast and attention were modeled
	as changes in driving current to the network neurons.We found that
	an increased driving current to the excitatory neurons increased
	the overall firing rate of the network, whereas variation of the
	driving current to inhibitory neurons modulated the synchrony of
	the network. We explain the synchrony modulation in terms of a locking
	phenomenon during which the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory firing
	rates is approximately constant for a range of driving current values.We
	explored the hypothesis that contrast is represented primarily as
	a drive to the excitatory neurons, whereas attention corresponds
	to a reduction in driving current to the inhibitory neurons. Using
	this hypothesis, the model reproduces the following experimental
	observations: (1) the firing rate of the excitatory neurons increases
	with contrast; (2) for high contrast stimuli, the firing rate saturates
	and the network synchronizes; (3) attention shifts the contrast response
	curve to lower contrast values; (4) attention leads to stronger synchronization
	that starts at a lower value of the contrast compared with the attend-away
	condition. In addition, it predicts that attention increases the
	delay between the inhibitory and excitatory synchronous volleys produced
	by the network, allowing the stimulus to recruit more downstream
	neurons.}

	tactile attention. Cues selectively directed subjects to attend to
	the roughness or duration of contact with embossed gratings that
	rubbed against a single fingertip with controlled speed and force.
	The task required discriminating between paired gratings that differed
	in tactile features of roughness and/or length. For different blocks
	of trials, cues directed attention to one tactile feature or indicated
	a divided attention strategy to a change in either feature. All attention
	conditions unambiguously activated several somatosensory foci in
	the parietal cortex, including somatotopically appropriate portions
	of the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus (S1)
	and the secondary somatosensory region (S2) within parietal opercular
	regions. There was no evidence for separate processing foci for selective
	and divided attention strategies, or for selectively attending to
	roughness versus stimulus duration. We observed a greater magnitude
	blood flow change in S2 versus S1 during attention tasks, which suggests
	that S2 might actually influence S1 activity. Despite these differences,
	modulation of S1 and S2 supports concepts of early selection in tactile
	attention. There were also examples of non-sensory foci in frontal
	cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral superior parietal
	regions at the fundus of the postcentral sulcus. Posterior parietal
	regions observed in this study did not overlap foci seen in studies
	of visual attention. Thus, the posterior parietal region may be subdivided
	into modality-specific subregions, each of which processes information
	needed to attend to a specific modality. These non-sensory areas
	may constitute a network that provides a source of modulating influences
	on the earlier stage, sensory areas.}

	of gamma power and local- and long-range gamma EEG coherence in neocortex
	and hippocampus during different cerebral states. We report significantly
	greater variability in gamma power across cortical regions during
	wakefulness than during either slow wave or rapid eye movement (REM)
	sleep. In addition, local (within cortical regions) and long-range
	(between cortical regions) gamma coherence was significantly higher
	during wakefulness than during sleep, and functional gamma-range
	coupling between the neocortex and hippocampus was seen during wakefulness,
	but not during sleep. These findings demonstrate a functional link
	between different stages of conscious awareness and the level of
	coupling of gamma-band oscillations in the human brain. }

	ear. It was concluded that the effective build up of streaming depends
	on attention. The second pair showed that patients with an attentional
	deficit toward the left side of space (unilateral neglect) show less
	stream segregation of tone sequences presented to their left than
	to their right ears. Streaming in their right ears was similar to
	that for stimuli presented to either ear of healthy and of brain-damaged
	controls, who showed no across-ear asymmetry. This result is consistent
	with an effect of attention on streaming, constrains the neural sites
	involved, and reveals a qualitative difference between the perception
	of left- and right-sided sounds by neglect patients.}

	2000. Principles of Neural Science. McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing,
	New York]. In order to study in detail the functional role of the
	intrinsic features of this cell we have developed a pre-compiled
	behavioural model based on the simplified granule-cell model of Bezzi
	et al. [Bezzi, M., Nieus, T., Arleo, A., D'Angelo, E., Coenen, O.J.-M.D.,
	2004. Information transfer at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse
	of the cerebellum. 34th Annual Meeting. Society for Neuroscience,
	San Diego, CA, USA]. We can use an efficient event-driven simulation
	scheme based on lookup tables (EDLUT) [Ros, E., Carrillo, R.R., Ortigosa,
	E.M., Barbour, B., Ags, R., 2006. Event-driven simulation scheme
	for spiking neural networks using lookup tables to characterize neuronal
	dynamics. Neural Computation 18 (12), 2959-2993]. For this purpose
	it is necessary to compile into tables the data obtained through
	a massive numerical calculation of the simplified cell model. This
	allows network simulations requiring minimal numerical calculation.
	There are three major features that are considered functionally relevant
	in the simplified granule cell model: bursting, subthreshold oscillations
	and resonance. In this work we describe how the cell model is compiled
	into tables keeping these key properties of the neuron model.}

	In trace conditioning, a short interval is interposed between the
	termination of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the onset of the
	unconditioned stimulus (US). In delay conditioning, the CS and US
	overlap. We here investigate the extent to which human classical
	fear conditioning depends on working memory. Subjects had to carry
	out an n-back task, requiring tracking an item 1 or 2 back in a sequentially
	presented list of numbers, while simultaneously being tested for
	their ability to associate auditory cues with shocks under a variety
	of conditions (single-cue versus differential; delay versus trace;
	no task versus 0-, 1-, and 2-back). Differential delay conditioning
	proved to be more resilient than differential trace conditioning
	but does show a reduction due to task interference similar in slope
	to that found in trace conditioning. Explicit knowledge of the stimulus
	contingency facilitates but does not guarantee trace conditioning.
	Only the single-cue delay protocol shows conditioning during the
	more difficult working memory task. Our findings suggest that the
	larger the cognitive demands on the system, the less likely conditioning
	occurs. A postexperimental questionnaire showed a positive correlation
	between conditioning and awareness for differential trace conditioning
	extinction.}

	Participants viewed sequences of images from five different classes-fractals,
	overhead satellite imagery, grayscale and colored natural scenes,
	and magazine covers-and graded each numerically according to its
	perceived conspicuity. We found significant consistency in this rating
	within and between observers for all image categories. In a subsequent
	recognition memory test, performance was significantly above chance
	for all categories, with the weakest memory for satellite imagery,
	and reaching near ceiling for magazine covers. When repeating the
	experiment after one year, ratings remained consistent within each

	Our findings suggest that the rating of image conspicuity is driven

  abstract = {Visual binding is the process by which the brain groups the elements
	belonging to one object, whilst segregating them from other scene
	elements. A computationally parsimonious mechanism of visual binding
	is the binding-by-synchrony (BBS) hypothesis. According to this hypothesis,
	detectors that respond to elements of a single object fire in synchrony,
	while detectors that respond to elements of different objects do
	not. Current psychophysical and physiological evidence are inconclusive
	about the role of BBS in the visual integration process. Here we
	provide psychophysical and computational evidence suggesting that
	the visual system implements a mechanism that synchronizes response
	onsets to object parts and attenuates or cancels their latency differences.
	In three experiments, observers had to judge the synchrony of two
	flickering Gabor patches embedded in a static Gabor contour, passing
	through fixation. We found that a smooth contour, as compared to
	a jagged one, impedes judgments of temporal synchrony between the
	targets, whilst facilitating non-temporal judgments of contrast on
	the same targets. We show that the results are consistent with a
	simple computational model that implements synchronization of responses
	via lateral interactions, enabling the visual system to pick up objects
	by synchrony among a temporally diverse background.}

	letters, has been explained as a lateral masking effect. The purpose
	of this study was to examine the spatial-frequency and contrast dependencies
	of crowding, and to compare them with the properties of pattern masking.
	In experiment 1, we measured contrast thresholds for identifying
	the middle letters in strings of three randomly chosen lower-case
	letters (trigrams), for a range of letter spacings. Letters were
	digitally filtered using a set of bandpass filters, with peak object
	spatial frequencies ranging from 0.63 to 10 c/letter. Bandwidth of
	the filters was 1 octave. Frequencies of the target and flanking
	letters were the same, or differed by up to 2 octaves. Contrast of
	the flanking letters was fixed at the maximum value. Testing was
	conducted at the fovea and 5 degrees eccentricity. We found that
	crowding exhibits spatial-tuning functions like masking, but with
	generally broader bandwidths than those for masking. The spatial
	extent of crowding was found to be about 0.5 deg at the fovea and
	2 deg at 5 degrees eccentricity, independent of target letter frequency.
	In experiment 2, we measured the contrast thresholds for identifying
	the middle target letters in trigrams for a range of flanking letter
	contrasts at 5 degrees eccentricity. At low flanker contrast, crowding
	does not show a facilitatory region, unlike pattern masking. At high
	flanker contrast, threshold rises with contrast with an exponent
	of 0.13-0.3, lower than corresponding exponents for pattern masking.
	In experiment 3, we varied the contrast ratio between the flanking
	letters and the target letters, and found that the magnitude of crowding
	increases monotonically with contrast ratio. This finding contradicts
	a prediction based on a grouping explanation for crowding. Our results
	are consistent with the postulation that crowding and masking may
	share the same first stage linear filtering process, and perhaps
	a similar second-stage process, with the additional property that
	the second-stage process in crowding pools information over a spatial
	extent that varies with eccentricity.}

	visual fields while subjects maintained central fixation and attended
	to one visual field at a time. Attended stimuli evoked enhanced P1
	(100-130 msec) and N1 (120-200 msec) components of the VEP, whereas
	no effects of attention were observed on the C1 (50-100 msec) or

	early VEP sources was carried out in relation to MRI-defined cortical
	anatomy. The dipolar generator of the CI component was found to lie
	in calcarine cortex, the human homologue of area Vl,whereas the attention-sensitive
	P1 generator was localized to ventral-lateral occipital cortex, within
	extrastriate area 19. These results support the hypothesis that spatial
	attention does not affect the initial activity evoked in area V1

  abstract = { Department of Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
	15260, USA. The space around us is represented not once but many
	times in parietal cortex. These multiple representations encode locations
	and objects of interest in several egocentric reference frames. Stimulus
	representations are transformed from the coordinates of receptor
	surfaces, such as the retina or the cochlea, into the coordinates
	of effectors, such as the eye, head, or hand. The transformation
	is accomplished by dynamic updating of spatial representations in
	conjunction with voluntary movements. This direct sensory-to-motor
	coordinate transformation obviates the need for a single representation
	of space in environmental coordinates. In addition to representing
	object locations in motoric coordinates, parietal neurons exhibit
	strong modulation by attention. Both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms
	of attention contribute to the enhancement of visual responses. The
	saliance of a stimulus is the primary factor in determining the neural
	response to it. Although parietal neurons represent objects in motor
	coordinates, visual responses are independent of the intention to
	perform specific motor acts.}

	each of two days were presented with tasks reflecting both attentional

	from frontal, parietal and temporal sites were recorded. Using a
	FFT (fast Fourier transform) electrocortical activity in the 2-7
	Hz, 8-15 Hz, and 16-24 Hz was determined and analyzed. The results
	suggest emotional valence (i.e. positive and negative) and attentional
	demands (i.e. intake vs rejection) are differentially represented
	in terms of EEG functioning. An interaction of attentional demand
	with hemisphere was found for EEG alpha activity in the temporal

	main effect for EEG beta activity in both the temporal and parietal

  abstract = {1. Outside-out patches were isolated from granule cells of dentate
	gyrus and pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1 regions of rat hippocampal
	slices. Patches were exposed briefly to L-glutamate using a piezo-driven
	double-barrelled application pipette. 2. Applications of glutamate
	(1 mM) of 1 ms duration activated patch currents which rose and decayed
	rapidly. The 20-80% rise time of these glutamate receptor (GluR)-mediated
	currents was usually 0.2-0.6 ms. At -50 mV the peak current varied
	from 10 to 500 pA in different patches. 3. The peak current-voltage
	relation for brief pulses of 1 mM glutamate was virtually linear
	in normal extracellular solution for patches from the three cell
	types (-100 to 60 mV). 4. The permeability of GluR channels activated
	at the peak to Ca2+, relative to K+, was less than 0.1 for all three
	cell types (under bi-ionic conditions with Ca2+ on the extracellular
	side and K+ on the intracellular side of the membrane). 5. The offset
	decay time constant of the current following 1 ms pulses of 1 mM
	glutamate was brief, with mean values of 3.0 +/- 0.8, 2.5 +/- 0.7,
	and 2.3 +/- 0.7 ms for dentate, CA3 and CA1 cell patches, respectively.
	Offset time constants were independent of membrane potential and
	independent of glutamate concentration (200 microM and 1 mM) for
	the three cell types. 6. Applications of 1 mM glutamate of 100 ms
	duration showed that glutamate responses desensitized rapidly. The
	time constants for desensitization were 9.4 +/- 2.7, 11.3 +/- 2.8,
	and 9.3 +/- 2.8 ms for patches from dentate, CA3 and CA1 cells respectively.
	Desensitization time constants were only weakly dependent on glutamate
	concentration (200 microM and 1 mM) for the three cell types. Thus
	offset time constants are about four times faster than desensitization
	time constants for both glutamate concentrations. 7. Double pulse
	application of glutamate indicated that even a 1 ms pulse of 1 mM
	glutamate causes partial (about 60%) desensitization of GluR channels.
	The time course of recovery from desensitization was slower in dentate
	gyrus granule cell patches than in CA3 or CA1 pyramidal cell patches.
	8. Desensitization was studied at equilibrium by exposing patches
	to low glutamate concentrations for at least 15 s before a 1 ms test
	pulse of 1 mM glutamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

  abstract = {1. We studied the spatial interaction between stimulus and attention
	in macaque area V4. Monkeys were required to fixate a small spot
	while continuously attending to a ring-shaped target within a large
	array of identical rings. Meanwhile, the response of the V4 cell
	under study was tested by flashing behaviorally irrelevant bar stimuli
	in the cell's classical receptive field (CRF). The location of the
	attended ring was varied across four positions surrounding the CRF,
	and the location of the bar stimulus was varied across five positions
	spanning the CRF. 2. Response strength depended on two aspects of
	the spatial relationship between the stimulus driving the cell (the
	bar) and the position of attention (the target ring). First, for
	49% of the cells studied, responses were greater for bar stimuli
	near the attended ring; i.e., the receptive field profile shifted
	toward the attentional focus. Second, for 84% of the cells, the overall
	response level depended on the direction in which attention lay relative
	to the stimulus in the CRF (e.g., to the left, right, above, or below).
	3. This study confirms a key prediction of spatial models of attention,
	which postulate enhanced processing of all stimuli near the attentional
	focus. It also introduces the novel finding that responses are influenced
	by the relative direction of attention. This result indicates that
	area V4 carries information about the spatial relationship between
	visual stimuli and attention.}

	that attentional response enhancement in macaque area V4 extends
	to behaviorally irrelevant objects in the vicinity of the target
	object, indicating that focal attention has a strong spatial component
	at the physiological level. In addition, we find that spatial attention
	effects typically show a striking directional asymmetry. The direction
	of the asymmetry varies between cells, so that some cells respond
	best when attention is directed to the left of the stimulus, some
	when attention is directed to the right, etc. Thus, attention involves
	not only enhanced responses to behavioral targets but also a complex
	modulation of responses to other stimuli in the surrounding visual

	in representing and recalling spatial relationships and in the ability
	to orient visual attention. This is evidenced by the parietal activation
	observed in brain imaging experiments performed during visuo- spatial
	tasks, and by the contralateral neglect syndrome that often accompanies
	parietal lesions. Individual neurons in monkey parietal cortex respond
	vigorously to the appearance of single, behaviorally relevant stimuli,
	but little is known about how they respond to more complex visual
	displays. The current experiments addressed this issue by recording
	activity from single neurons in area 7a of the PPC in monkeys performing
	a spatial version of a match-to-sample task. The task required them
	to locate salient stimuli in multiple-stimulus displays and release
	a lever after a subsequent stimulus appeared at the same location.
	Neurons responded preferentially to the appearance of salient stimuli
	inside their receptive fields. The presence of multiple stimuli did
	not affect appreciably the spatial tuning of responses in the majority
	of neurons or the population code for the location of the salient
	stimulus. Responses to salient stimuli could be distinguished from
	background stimuli approximately 100 ms after the onset of the cue.
	These results suggest that area 7a neurons represent the location

	the result of the target's and nontarget's being processed to the
	point of evoking competing responses. Subjects err by responding
	with the nontarget. Target identification may also be interfered
	with because the target and nontarget form a composite pattern through
	temporal integration, and subjects are unable to separate the features
	of the target and nontarget patterns. The present study addressed
	the issue of whether a response competition explanation of interference
	is consistent with the existence of temporal integration and the
	formation of composite patterns. A series of three experiments examined
	temporal integration and its relationship to response competition.
	The results indicate that both temporal integration and response
	competition can occur under similar stimulus conditions, and that
	both can interfere with the identification of target patterns. The
	results further indicate that even under conditions in which composite
	patterns are formed, the two patterns that constitute the composite
	are still identifiable. It is concluded that the interference in
	pattern identification attributed to response competition is not
	a result of temporal integration.},

	CRAIGJ@INDIANA.EDU. Tactile spatial acuity on the fingerpad was measured
	using a grating orientation task. In this task, subjects are required
	to identify the orientation of square-wave gratings placed on the
	skin. Previous studies have shown that performance varies as a function
	of the width of the grooves in the gratings. In the present study,
	both groove width and the overall size and configuration of the contactors
	were varied. Sensitivity improved with wider grooves and with larger
	contactors. Additional measurements showed that the improved sensitivity
	is not the result of the increase in total area contacted, but rather
	is due to two other factors associated with larger contactors. One
	is the greater linear extent of the larger contactors. The other
	appears to be due to the reduction in the interference produced by
	the outer edge of the contactor. Specifically, as the contactor increases
	in size, the distance between the outer edge and the center portion
	of the grooves also increases. It was also shown that subjects are
	more sensitive to a single, continuous groove as compared with two
	grooves of the same total length but spatially discontinuous. Similarly,
	subjects are more sensitive to a contactor with a continuous groove
	than to a contactor in which just the end points of the groove are
	presented. The results are generally consistent with the results
	of peripheral, neurophysiological recordings. The results are discussed
	in terms of the way in which both spatial and intensive factors may
	affect sensitivity to grating orientation.},

	we cover peripheral sensory mechanisms and several topics related
	to spatial and temporal pattern perception, specifically measures
	of spatial sensitivity, texture perception with particular emphasis
	on perceived roughness, complex spatial-temporal patterns, and the
	use of touch as a possible channel of communication. Other topics
	under this section include the effects of attention on processing
	tactile stimuli, cortical mechanisms, and the effects of aging on
	sensitivity. We also deal with thermal sensitivity and some aspects
	of haptics and kinesthesis. In the section on pain, we review work
	on the gate-control theory, sensory fibers, and higher neural organization.
	In addition, studies on central neurochemical effects and psychophysics

	unitary representations of objects. Recent evidence has indicated
	a close link between this binding process and 40-hertz (gamma-band)
	oscillations generated by localized neural circuits. In a separate
	line of research, the ability of young infants to perceive objects
	as unitary and bounded has become a central focus for debates about
	the mechanisms of perceptual development. Here we demonstrate that
	binding-related 40-hertz oscillations are evident in the infant brain
	around 8 months of age, which is the same age at which behavioral
	and event-related potential evidence indicates the onset of perceptual
	binding of spatially separated static visual features.}

	of the background; in the latter, bold contrasting colours on the
	animal's periphery break up its outline. The latter has long been
	proposed as an explanation for some apparently conspicuous coloration
	in animals, and is standard textbook material. Surprisingly, only
	one quantitative test of the theory exists, and one experimental
	test of its effectiveness against non-human predators. Here we test
	two key predictions: that patterns on the body's outline should be
	particularly effective in promoting concealment and that highly contrasting
	colours should enhance this disruptive effect. Artificial moth-like
	targets were exposed to bird predation in the field, with the experimental
	colour patterns on the 'wings' and a dead mealworm as the edible
	'body'. Survival analysis supported the predictions, indicating that
	disruptive coloration is an effective means of camouflage, above
	and beyond background pattern matching.}

	Synaptic Time Constants},
  journal = nc,
  year = {2008},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {The simulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) is known to be a
	very time-consuming task. This limits the size of SNN that can be
	simulated in reasonable time or forces users to overly limit the
	complexity of the neuron models. This is one of the driving forces
	behind much of the recent research on event-driven simulation strategies.
	Although event-driven simulation allows precise and efficient simulation
	of certain spiking neuron models, it is not straightforward to generalize
	the technique to more complex neuron models, mostly because the firing
	time of these neuron models is computationally expensive to evaluate.
	Most solutions proposed in literature concentrate on algorithms that
	can solve this problem efficiently. However, these solutions do not
	scale well when more state variables are involved in the neuron model,
	which is, for example, the case when multiple synaptic time constants
	for each neuron are used. In this letter, we show that an exact predict
	ion of the firing time is not required in order to guarantee exact
	simulation results. Several techniques are presented that try to
	do the least possible amount of work to predict the firing times.
	We propose an elegant al for the simulation of leaky integrate-and-fire
	(LIF) neurons with an arbitrary number of (unconstrained) synaptic
	time constants, which is able to combine these algorithmic techniques
	efficiently, resulting in very high simulation speed. Moreover, our
	algorithm is highly independent of the complexity (i.e., number of
	synaptic time constants) of the underlying neuron model.},

  volume = {71},
  pages = {375-400},

  abstract = {1. Both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic channels were added
	to a previously described complex compartmental model of a cerebellar
	Purkinje cell to examine model responses to synaptic inputs. All
	model parameters remained as described previously, leaving maximum
	synaptic conductance as the only parameter that was tuned in the
	studies described in this paper. Under these conditions the model
	was capable of reproducing physiological recorded responses to each
	of the major types of synaptic input. 2. When excitatory synapses
	were activated on the smooth dendrites of the model, the model generated
	a complex dendritic Ca2+ spike similar to that generated by climbing
	fiber inputs. Examination of the model showed that activation of
	P-type Ca2+ channels in both the smooth and spiny dendrites augmented
	the depolarization during the complex spike and that Ca2+-activated
	K+ channels in the same dendritic regions determined the duration
	of the spike. When these synapses were activated under simulated
	current-clamp conditions the model also generated the characteristic
	dual reversal potential of the complex spike. The shape of the dendritic
	complex spike could be altered by changing the maximum conductance
	of the climbing fiber synapse and thus the amount of Ca2+ entering
	the cell. 3. To explore the background simple spike firing properties
	of Purkinje cells in vivo we added excitatory ''parallel fiber''
	synapses to the spiny dendritic branches of the model. Continuous
	asynchronous activation of these granule cell synapses resulted in
	the generation of spontaneous sodium spikes. However, very low asynchronous
	input frequencies produced a highly regular, very fast rhythm(80-120
	Hz), whereas slightly higher input frequencies resulted in Purkinje
	cell bursting. Both types of activity are uncharacteristic of in
	vivo Purkinje cell recordings. 4. Inhibitory synapses of the sort
	presumably generated by stellate cells were also added to the dendritic
	tree. When asynchronous activation of these inhibitory synapses was
	combined with continuous asynchronous excitatory input the model
	generated somatic action potentials in a much more stochastic pattern
	typical of real Purkinje cells. Under these conditions simulated
	interspike interval distributions resembled those found in experimental
	recordings. Also, as with in vivo recordings, the model did not generate
	dendritic bursts. This was mainly due to inhibition that suppressed
	the generation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. 5. In the presence of asynchronous
	inhibition, changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs
	modulated background simple spike firing frequencies in the natural
	range of Purkinje cell firing frequencies( 30-100 Hz). This modulation
	was very sensitive to small changes in the average frequency of excitatory
	inputs. In addition, changes in inhibitory frequency caused a parallel
	shift of the relationship between excitatory input and spiking frequency.
	Because of the specific cerebellar circuitry, inhibitory inputs may
	allow Purkinje cells to detect small fluctuations in excitatory input
	at any mean frequency of input. 6. When climbing fiber input was
	given in the presence of background asynchronous excitatory and inhibitory
	inputs the shape of the complex spike in the soma was significantly
	affected. However, the shape of the spike in the dendrites was almost
	constant. This difference reflected the more variable excitability
	of the soma compared with the dendrites. 7. Synchronous activation
	of basket cell inhibitory synapses during asynchronous activation
	of granule and stellate cell synapses interrupted somatic spiking.
	However, the hyperpolarization caused by the basket cell synapse
	did not penetrate far into the dendrite but stayed localized to the
	soma and main dendrite. 8. This simulation work demonstrates that
	a model based on voltage-clamp data and tuned entirely on the response
	of Purkinje cells to current injection is capable of reproducing
	a wide range of synaptically activated responses. In the presence
	of continuous granule cell excitation the model showed a stable in
	vivo state different from the silent, resting in vitro state. Further,
	the model suggests that there may be important functional interactions
	between different types of synaptic inputs. In particular, it makes
	several specific predictions about the role of stellate cell inhibition.},

	anatomic reconstructions of single Purkinje cells and included 10
	different types of voltage-dependent channels described by Hodgkin-Huxley
	equations, derived from Purkinje cell-specific voltage-clamp data
	where available. These channels included a fast and persistent Na+
	channel, three voltage-dependent K+ channels, T-type and P-type Ca2+
	channels, and two types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. 2. The ionic
	channels were distributed differentially over three zones of the
	model, with Na+ channels in the soma, fast K+ channels in the soma
	and main dendrite, and Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-activated K+ channels
	in the entire dendrite. Channel densities in the model were varied
	until it could reproduce Purkinje cell responses to current injections
	in the soma or dendrite, as observed in slice recordings. 3. As in
	real Purkinje cells, the model generated two types of spiking behavior.
	In response to small current injections the model fired exclusively
	fast somatic spikes. These somatic spikes were caused by Na+ channels
	and repolarized by the delayed rectifier. When higher-amplitude current
	injections were given, sodium spiking increased in frequency until
	the model generated large dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Analysis of membrane
	currents underlying this behavior showed that these Ca2+ spikes were
	caused by the P-type Ca2+ channel and repolarized by the BK-type
	Ca2+-activated K+ channel. As in pharmacological blocking experiments,
	removal of Na+ channels abolished the fast spikes and removal of
	Ca2+ channels removed Ca2+ spiking. 4. In addition to spiking behavior,
	the model also produced slow plateau potentials in both the dendrite
	and soma. These longer-duration potentials occurred in response to
	both short and prolonged current steps. Analysis of the model demonstrated
	that the plateau potentials in the soma were caused by the window
	current component of the fast Na+ current, which was much larger
	than the current through the persistent Na+ channels. Plateau potentials
	in the dendrite were carried by the same P-type Ca2+ channel that
	was also responsible for Ca2+ spike generation. The P channel could
	participate in both model functions because of the low-threshold
	K2-type Ca2+-activated K+ channel, which dynamically changed the
	threshold for dendritic spike generation through a negative feedback
	loop with the activation kinetics of the P-type Ca2+ channel. 5.
	These model responses were robust to changes in the densities of
	all of the ionic channels. For most of the channels, modifying their
	densities by factors of greater than or equal to 2 resulted only
	in left or right shifts of the frequency-current curve. However,
	changes of >20% to the amount of P-type Ca2+ channels or of one of
	the Ca2+-activated K+ channels in the model either suppressed dendritic
	spikes or caused the model to always fire Ca2+ spikes. Modeling results
	were also robust to variations in Purkinje cell morphology. We simulated
	models of two other anatomically reconstructed Purkinje cells with
	the same channel distributions and got similar responses to current
	injections. 6. The model was used to compare the electrotonic length
	of the Purkinje cell in the presence and absence of active dendritic
	conductances. The electrotonic distance from soma to the tip of the
	most distal dendrite increased from 0 57 lambda in a passive model
	to 0.95 lambda in a quiet model with active membrane. During a dendritic
	spike generated by current injection the distance increased even
	more, to 1.57 lambda. 7. Finally, the model was used to study the
	probable accuracy of experimental voltage-clamp data. Whole-cell
	patch-clamp conditions were simulated by blocking most of the K+
	currents in the model. The increased electrotonic length due to the
	active dendritic membrane caused space clamp to fail, resulting in
	membrane potentials in proximal and distal dendrites that differed
	critically from the holding potential in the soma.},

	In contrast to animal studies, relatively little is known about the
	functional significance of the early evoked gamma band activity in
	humans. We investigated whether evoked and induced 40 Hz activity
	differentiate automatic, bottom-up aspects of attention from voluntary,
	top-down related attentional demands. An auditory novelty-oddball
	task was applied to 14 healthy subjects. As predicted, more evoked
	gamma was found for the target condition than in the two task-irrelevant
	conditions. Since gamma band activity was not enhanced for novel
	stimuli, the evoked gamma response cannot be explained with a simple
	concept of stimulus arousal. Neither induced gamma nor the degree
	of 40 Hz phase-locking were different between the experimental conditions.
	Taken together, our data emphasize the role of evoked gamma band
	activity for top-down attentional processing}

	attention serves to enhance extrastriate neuronal responses to a

	that any enhancing effect of attention is best understood in the
	context of competitive interactions among neurons representing all

	be biased in favour of behaviourally relevant stimuli as a result
	of many different processes, both spatial and non-spatial, and both
	bottom-up and top-down. The resolution of this competition results
	in the suppression of the neuronal representations of behaviourally
	irrelevant stimuli in extrastriate cortex. A main source of top-down

	Control responses to homogeneous (100%) series of identical stimuli
	(thus eliminating input mismatch) while the subject reads a novel
	(thus providing a distinct attention-capturing activity and maintaining
	vigilance level) are validated as reflecting the exogenous obligatory
	profiles required for assessing cognitive component in ERPs to target
	relevant stimuli. With these 'neutral' conditions, the control responses
	have a similar profile even at larger ISIs such as those separating
	the infrequent targets in Attention runs. Conversely, series of stimuli
	identical to those in control runs can elicit cognitive components
	in a 'Lie' experiment when the subject is induced to treat the stimuli
	like targets even though there is no discrimination involved. On
	this basis, the somatosensory P30, P40, P100 and N140 components
	appearing in the target profiles are considered genuine cognitive
	components. They have been analyzed with scatter displays, electronic
	subtraction, bit-mapped displays and with calculation of Z and dilation
	factors. The cognitive P30 and P40 reflect selective attention-related
	enhancements of the neural generators in receiving somatosensory
	cortex. The early parietal positivity P27 can thus be modulated separately
	from the frontal N30 component and is thought to be generated by
	a radial dipole in area 1. The later cognitive P100 and N140 reflect
	the invocation of distinct processors in conjunction with the behavioral
	use of the sensory input. The evolving topographical patterns of
	the P100 and N140 electrogeneses, revealed by bit-mapped data, suggest
	complex interactions between posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex
	whereby the sensory information is placed into spatial coordinate
	systems and matched with representations of relevant objects or relationships
	in space for target processing in the sequential tasks.}

  journal = {J Comput Neurosci},
  year = {2009},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are
	known to display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which
	resemble the discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of
	awake animals. However, it is not clear whether such activity states
	are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks
	where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar
	to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence
	of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive
	exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can
	display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular
	spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the
	oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical
	networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case,
	sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a
	few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in
	cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states
	for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role
	of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong
	SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced,
	AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical
	networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI
	state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays
	Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings
	during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down
	states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with
	LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as
	adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the
	genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks.}

	62 area 3b neurons were studied with three to eight scanning directions

	a single, central excitatory region of short duration, (2) one or
	more inhibitory regions, also of short duration, that are adjacent
	to and nearly synchronous with the excitation, and (3) a region of
	inhibition that overlaps the excitation partially or totally and
	is temporally delayed with respect to the first two components. The
	mean correlation between the observed RFs and the RFs predicted by

  abstract = {Neural synchrony has been proposed as a solution to the binding problem.
	To test this hypothesis, we analyzed single-unit activity recorded
	from 32 pairs of neurons in cortical areas V1 and V2 of two awake
	behaving monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We also characterized neurons
	in terms of border ownership properties (Zhou et al., J Neurosci
	20: 6594, 2000). Animals performed a fixation task while two types
	of stimuli were presented in parafoveal vision. One was a quadrilateral
	with two of its edges in the classical receptive fields of the two
	neurons under study. The other stimulus consisted of two non-overlapping
	rectangles that were positioned such that they produced exactly the
	same edges in these receptive fields as the single quadrilateral.
	The local contrast in the receptive fields was also identical. The
	hypothesis to be tested was whether representation of the same visual
	object by two neurons, as in the first case, makes them fire more
	synchronously than in the second case when they represent different
	objects. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the correlation structure
	of the spike trains generated in these two conditions. In cell pairs
	in which both members were modulated by border ownership we found
	increased synchrony between the one-object (binding) condition compared
	with the two-object condition. No increased synchrony was found in
	the other cell pairs. We attribute the synchronization in border
	ownership sensitive pairs to common input from "grouping cells" which
	have been postulated in a recent model to explain border ownership
	selectivity (Craft et al., J Vision 4:728, 2004). Grouping cells
	integrate co-circular edge signals and enhance the gain of the corresponding
	edge cells by feedback, thus imparting them with border ownership
	selectivity. The model predicts that synchronization should occur
	between border ownership cells, but not between other cells in visual
	cortex. In summary, synchronization tends to occur between border
	ownership selective cells. A plausible explanation is common input
	from neurons involved in figure-ground organization NSF-CRCNS/NIH-NEI

  address = {Washington DE},
  organization = {Society for Neuroscience},
  abstract = {Among the plethora of neuronal network simulators available to the
	neuroscience community (Brette et al., J Comput Neurosci, 2007),
	some (e.g. NEURON) emphasize the realism of the underlying single-unit
	model, while others use very simple models for the sake of efficiency
	of network simulations. Our goal is to create a simulator of an intermediate
	level of biological realism that is efficient, platform-independent,
	and endowed with a friendly user interface. It is based on an event-driven
	algorithm (Mattia & Giudice, Neural Comput, 12(10), 2000) for point
	neurons, which computes spike times approximation-free (i.e., with
	machine precision). For neuronal model, we used a versatile and efficient
	generalization of the integrate-and-fire model (Mihalas and Niebur,
	this volume). Other, custom-written, neuronal models can be integrated
	as well. Multiple neuronal models can be simultaneously used in the
	same network. The simulator is written in JAVA, uses the Java Parallel
	Virtual Machine (JPVM) (Adam Ferrari, Concurrency: Practice and Experience,
	10(11-13),1998), and runs in heterogeneous systems of arbitrary size
	and machine architecture without recompilation. Resources are distributed
	efficiently over all available machines, with simulations of smaller
	neuronal networks progressing with different parameter sets (e.g.
	different experimental settings) in parallel on separate machines,
	while large neuronal networks are distributed over the machines,
	with sub-networks communicating by event-based methods. Network description
	and experimental parameter specification are written in the XML format.
	Tools for efficient generation of layered networks as well as extensive
	Java-based visualization tools are provided. In an example, we simulated
	the primate early visual system using natural images as inputs and
	including area V1. The model of 1,361,250 neurons and 24,030,000
	synapses of realistic firing rate was distributed over eight AMD64
	machines, 1GB memory each. The simulation takes 1m54s per second
	of simulated time, plus 54s setup-time to establish the connectivity.

  abstract = {The role of fast, or gamma band (20-80 Hz), local field potential
	(LFP) oscillations in representing neuronal activity and in encoding
	motor behavior was examined in motor cortex of two alert monkeys.
	Using chronically implanted microwires, we simultaneously recorded
	LFPs and single or multiple unit (MU) discharge at a group of sites
	in the precentral gyrus during trained finger force or reaching movements,
	during natural reaching and grasping, and during quiet sitting. We
	evaluated the coupling of oscillations with task-related firing at
	the same site, the timing of oscillations with respect to the execution
	of trained and untrained movement, and the temporal synchrony of
	oscillations across motor cortical sites. LFPs and neural discharge
	were examined from a total of 16 arm sites (7 sites in 1 monkey and
	9 in the other), each showing movement-related discharge modulation
	and arm microstimulation effects. In the trained tasks, fast LFP
	and MU oscillations occurred most often during a premovement delay
	period, ceasing around movement onset. The decrease in oscillation
	roughly coincided with the appearance of firing rate modulation coupled
	to the motor action. During this delay, LFP oscillations exhibited
	either overlapping or mixed relationships with the simultaneously
	recorded neural discharge at that site. Overlap was characterized
	by coincident epochs of increased neural discharge and LFP oscillations.
	For the mixed pattern, episodes of LFP oscillation typically coincided
	with periods of diminished firing but overlap also sometimes appeared.
	Both patterns occurred concurrently across motor cortex during preparation;
	LFP suppression with motor action was ubiquitous. Fast oscillations
	reappeared quickly upon transition from quiet sitting to resumption
	of task performance, indicating an association with task engagement,
	rather than the general motor inaction of the delay period. In contrast
	to trained movements, fast oscillations often appeared along with
	movement during untrained reaching, but oscillations occurred erratically
	and were not reliably correlated with elevated neural discharge.
	Synchronous oscillations occurred at sites as much as 5 mm apart,
	suggesting widespread coupling of neurons and LFP signals in motor
	cortex. Widespread coupling of oscillatory signals is consistent
	with the concept that temporal coding processes operate in motor
	cortex. However, because the relationship between neuronal discharge
	and the appearance of fast oscillations may be altered by behavioral
	condition, they must reflect a global process active in conjunction
	with motor planning or preparatory functions, but not details of
	motor action encoded in neuronal firing rate.}

	The aim of the present experiment was to investigate attentional
	processing of colour and location cues using a detection task. Subjects
	were required to respond to cued corners of a line drawing of a three-dimensional
	cube. Both cue and target were highlighted in red or green in one
	corner of the cube. Cues could be valid or invalid with respect to
	both the colour and location of subsequent targets. Results indicated
	a significant main effect of location validity, but no main effect
	of colour validity. Results also indicated that significant colour
	cueing effects were evident when location cues were invalid. These
	data also suggested different time courses for the processing of
	location and colour information. Location validity effects were largest
	at the shortest interstimulus interval (ISI) and decreased slightly
	with increasing ISI. In contrast, colour validity effects were absent
	at the shortest ISI, but thereafter increased with increasing ISI.
	The results of this experiment indicate that colour cues can be effective
	even in an inherently spatial task, provided there is sufficient
	time for the processing of colour information. }

	Across systems competition is integrated such that the same, selected

	a simple attentional imbalance. The functional imaging studies show
	joint involvement of lateral prefrontal and occipital cortex in lateral

	Discrimination-based theories propose a limit on the number of separate

	To distinguish these views, the present experiments used small (less

  journal = {Neuroscience},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {76},
  pages = {39-54},
  abstract = {Universitat Heidelberg, II. Physiologisches Institut, Germany. Current
	knowledge of spinal processing of sensory information is largely
	based on single-cell recordings; however, temporal correlation of
	multiple cell discharges may play an important role in sensory encoding,
	and single electrode recordings of several neurons may provide insights
	into the functions of a neuronal network. The technique was applied
	to the lumbar spinal dorsal horn of pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats
	during background activity, steady-state noxious heat stimulation
	(48 degrees C, 100 s), cold block spinalization or radiant heat-induced
	inflammation of the skin, and the recordings were evaluated by means
	of auto-correlation, autospectral and cross-correlation analysis.
	Background patterns obtained by these three methods were extremely
	stable in time. Autocorrelation with short lag peaks was observed
	in 72.2% of neurons (n = 223). Background correlated discharges were
	found in 83.6% of the neuron pairs (n = 134). Cross-correlation with
	a central peak, suggestive of common input to the recorded cells,
	was the most common pattern observed in almost all laminae and was
	associated with high incidence (91.8%) of overlapping receptive fields
	and with neurons with initial peak autocorrelation pattern. Cross-correlations
	with central trough were associated with increase autocorrelation
	patterns. Bilateral peaks in cross-correlation, suggestive of reverberating
	circuitry, were observed only for pairs of neurons located in laminae
	IV and V and were associated with rhythmic discharges in one or in
	both simultaneously-recorded neurons. Lagged peaks or troughs were
	observed in 4.6% and 2.2% of neuronal pairs, respectively. Long-lasting
	skin heating induced qualitative changes (pattern changes) in the
	cross-correlation of 21.6% of the neuron pairs and quantitative changes
	in 85.7% of them. During skin inflammation qualitative changes in
	the cross-correlation pattern were observed in 30.8% of the neuron
	pairs, and quantitative changes (strength and/or synchronization
	time) in about 57.7% of them. Spinalization induced quantitative
	changes in cross-correlation in the vast majority of neuron pairs.
	The results of the present study suggest that discharges of neighbouring
	spinal dorsal horn neurons are strongly synchronized probably by
	propriospinal and primary afferent sources. The existence of functional
	reverberating circuitry was also evidenced. Finally, the functional
	synchronicity in the spinal dorsal horn presents stimulus-induced
	plasticity which consists mainly of changes on the strength and/or
	time of the synchronization and rarely of activation of new connectivities.}

  pages = {161--174},
  abstract = {Traditionally, most of the information processing of neural networks
	is thought to be carried out by excitatory cells. Likewise, recent
	evidence for temporal coding comes from the study of the detailed
	firing patterns of excitatory neurons. In the CA1 region of the rat
	hippocampus, pyramidal cells discharge selectively when the animal
	is in specific locations in its environment, and exhibit a precise
	relationship with the ongoing rhythmic activity of the network (phase
	precession). We demonstrate that during a spatial exploratory behavior
	on a linear track, inhibitory interneurons also show spatial selectivity
	and phase precession dynamics. We found that the firing rate of interneurons
	is modulated reliably up and down around an ongoing baseline activity
	level for specific locations in the environment, producing robust
	place-specific increases or decreases in discharge. On some sections
	of the track, the range of theta phases shifts progressively to earlier
	parts of the theta cycle as the rat advances, so that a negative
	correlation between phase and position could be demonstrated. Unlike
	pyramidal cells, phase and rate were not strongly correlated. We
	discuss the influence of the intrinsic firing properties of interneurons
	on a model of phase precession, as well as the influence of the detailed
	shape of the inhibitory oscillation. These results indicate that
	spatial selectivity and phase precession in CA1 are not properties
	restricted to pyramidal cells. Rather, they may be a more general
	expression of a common interaction between the different inputs impinging
	on both excitatory and inhibitory cells in CA1 and the intrinsic
	characteristics of those cells. Furthermore, they suggest that the
	role of interneurons may extend beyond a global damping of the network
	by participating in a finely-tuned local processing with the pyramidal
	cells.}

	no focal attention is required for overall performance in such tasks.
	Little is known, however, of how detection performance varies from
	trial to trial and which stages in the processing hierarchy limit
	performance: bottom-up visual processing (attentional selection and/or
	recognition) or top-down factors (e.g., decision-making, memory,
	or alertness fluctuations)? To investigate the relative contribution
	of these factors, eight human observers performed an animal detection
	task in natural scenes presented at 20 Hz. Trial-by-trial performance
	was highly consistent across observers, far exceeding the prediction
	of independent errors. This consistency demonstrates that performance
	is not primarily limited by idiosyncratic factors but by visual processing.
	Two statistical stimulus properties, contrast variation in the target
	image and the information-theoretical measure of ``surprise'' in
	adjacent images, predict performance on a trial-by-trial basis. These
	measures are tightly related to spatial attention, demonstrating
	that spatial attention and rapid target detection share common mechanisms.
	To isolate the causal contribution of the surprise measure, eight
	additional observers performed the animal detection task in sequences
	that were reordered versions of those all subjects had correctly
	recognized in the first experiment. Reordering increased surprise
	before and/or after the target while keeping the target and distractors
	themselves unchanged. Surprise enhancement impaired target detection
	in all observers. Consequently, and contrary to several previously
	published findings, our results demonstrate that attentional limitations,
	rather than target recognition alone, affect the detection of targets
	in rapidly presented visual sequences.},

  abstract = {In natural vision both stimulus features and task-demands affect an
	observer's attention. However, the relationship between sensory-driven
	("bottom-up") and task-dependent ("top-down") factors remains controversial:
	Can task-demands counteract strong sensory signals fully, quickly,
	and irrespective of bottom-up features? To measure attention under
	naturalistic conditions, we recorded eye-movements in human observers,
	while they viewed photographs of outdoor scenes. In the first experiment,
	smooth modulations of contrast biased the stimuli's sensory-driven
	saliency towards one side. In free-viewing, observers' eye-positions
	were immediately biased toward the high-contrast, i.e., high-saliency,
	side. However, this sensory-driven bias disappeared entirely when
	observers searched for a bull's-eye target embedded with equal probability
	to either side of the stimulus. When the target always occurred in
	the low-contrast side, observers' eye-positions were immediately
	biased towards this low-saliency side, i.e., the sensory-driven bias
	reversed. Hence, task-demands do not only override sensory-driven
	saliency but also actively countermand it. In a second experiment,
	a 5-Hz flicker replaced the contrast gradient. Whereas the bias was
	less persistent in free viewing, the overriding and reversal took
	longer to deploy. Hence, insufficient sensory-driven saliency cannot
	account for the bias reversal. In a third experiment, subjects searched
	for a spot of locally increased contrast ("oddity") instead of the
	bull's-eye ("template"). In contrast to the other conditions, a slight
	sensory-driven free-viewing bias prevails in this condition. In a
	fourth experiment, we demonstrate that at known locations template
	targets are detected faster than oddity targets, suggesting that
	the former induce a stronger top-down drive when used as search targets.
	Taken together, task-demands can override sensory-driven saliency
	in complex visual stimuli almost immediately, and the extent of overriding
	depends on the search target and the overridden feature, but not
	on the latter's free-viewing saliency.}

  pages = {1-26},
  number = {14},
  abstract = {Humans move their eyes while looking at scenes and pictures. Eye movements
	correlate with shifts in attention and are thought to be a consequence
	of optimal resource allocation for high-level tasks such as visual
	recognition. Models of attention, such as 'saliency maps,' are often
	built on the assumption that 'early' features (color, contrast, orientation,
	motion, and so forth) drive attention directly. We explore an alternative
	hypothesis: Observers attend to âinterestingâ objects. To test this
	hypothesis, we measure the eye position of human observers while
	they inspect photographs of common natural scenes. Our observers
	perform different tasks: artistic evaluation, analysis of content,
	and search. Immediately after each presentation, our observers are
	asked to name objects they saw. Weighted with recall frequency, these
	objects predict fixations in individual images better than early
	saliency, irrespective of task. Also, saliency combined with object
	positions predicts which objects are frequently named. This suggests
	that early saliency has only an indirect effect on attention, acting
	through recognized objects. Consequently, rather than treating attention
	as mere preprocessing step for object recognition, models of both
	need to be integrated. }

	Here we recorded the activity of prefrontal neurons in monkeys carrying
	out a focused attention task. Having directed attention to one location,
	monkeys monitored a stream of visual objects, awaiting a predefined
	target. Although neurons rarely discriminated between one non-target
	and another, they commonly discriminated between targets and non-targets.
	From the onset of the visual response, this target/non-target discrimination
	was effectively eliminated when the same objects appeared at an unattended
	location in the opposite visual hemifield. The results show that,
	in prefrontal cortex, filtering of ignored locations is strong, early
	and spatially global. Such filtering may be important in blindness
	to unattended signals--a conspicuous aspect of human selective attention.}

	We study the temporal features represented by salamander retinal
	ganglion cells by stimulating with dynamic spatially uniform flicker
	and recording responses using a multi-electrode array. While standard
	reverse correlation methods determine a single stimulus feature--the
	spike-triggered average--multiple features can be relevant to spike
	generation. We apply covariance analysis to determine the set of
	features to which each ganglion cell is sensitive. Using this approach,
	we found that salamander ganglion cells represent a rich vocabulary
	of different features of a temporally modulated visual stimulus.
	Individual ganglion cells were sensitive to at least two and sometimes
	as many as six features in the stimulus. While a fraction of the
	cells can be described by a filter-and-fire cascade model, many cells
	have feature selectivity that has not previously been reported. These
	reverse models were able to account for 80-100% of the information
	encoded by ganglion cells.}

	Evidence from several sources suggests that visual attention is tuned
	to stimulus scale. This tuning impairs performance when the observer
	must attend to more than one scale at a time. In experiments originally
	designed to measure the bandwidth of attention to stimulus scale,
	we have found tasks in which observers show no attentional tuning
	for scale. In separate blocks, observers located or identified targets
	in arrays of elements, either numbers in arrays of letters or static
	squares in arrays of flashing squares. Each display contained two
	arrays, either of the same scale or of different scales. The accuracy
	of locating the target element was lower in mixed-scale than in single-scale
	displays, but the accuracy of identifying the target was unaffected
	by a mixing of scales within the same display. This holds for both
	high-level discriminations--numbers vs letters--and low-level discriminations--static
	vs flashing. Thus, at least for identifying, one can attend to large
	and small at the same time. The difference in bandwidth between "what"
	and "where" implies that stimulus identification is not dependent
	on prior localization.},

  abstract = {In the light of results obtained during the last two decades in a
	number of laboratories, it appears that some of the tools of nonlinear
	dynamics, first developed and improved for the physical sciences
	and engineering, are well-suited for studies of biological phenomena.
	In particular it has become clear that the different regimes of activities
	undergone by nerve cells, neural assemblies and behavioural patterns,
	the linkage between them, and their modifications over time, cannot
	be fully understood in the context of even integrative physiology,
	without using these new techniques. This report, which is the first
	of two related papers, is aimed at introducing the non expert to
	the fundamental aspects of nonlinear dynamics, the most spectacular
	aspect of which is chaos theory. After a general history and definition
	of chaos the principles of analysis of time series in phase space
	and the general properties of chaotic trajectories will be described
	as will be the classical measures which allow a process to be classified
	as chaotic in ideal systems and models. We will then proceed to show
	how these methods need to be adapted for handling experimental time
	series; the dangers and pitfalls faced when dealing with non stationary
	and often noisy data will be stressed, and specific criteria for
	suspecting determinism in neuronal cells and/or assemblies will be
	described. We will finally address two fundamental questions, namely
	i) whether and how can one distinguish, deterministic patterns from
	stochastic ones, and, ii) what is the advantage of chaos over randomness:
	we will explain why and how the former can be controlled whereas,
	notoriously, the latter cannot be tamed. In the second paper of the
	series, results obtained at the level of single cells and their membrane
	conductances in real neuronal networks and in the study of higher
	brain functions, will be critically reviewed. It will be shown that
	the tools of nonlinear dynamics can be irreplaceable for revealing
	hidden mechanisms subserving, for example, neuronal synchronization
	and periodic oscillations. The benefits for the brain of adopting
	chaotic regimes with their wide range of potential behaviours and
	their aptitude to quickly react to changing conditions will also
	be considered.},

	as the glance becomes longer? We asked naive subjects to report in
	a free-form format what they saw when looking at briefly presented
	real-life photographs. Our subjects received no specific information
	as to the content of each stimulus. Thus, our paradigm differs from
	previous studies where subjects were cued before a picture was presented
	and/or were probed with multiple-choice questions. In the first stage,
	90 novel grayscale photographs were foveally shown to a group of
	22 native-English-speaking subjects. The presentation time was chosen
	at random from a set of seven possible times (from 27 to 500 ms).
	A perceptual mask followed each photograph immediately. After each
	presentation, subjects reported what they had just seen as completely
	and truthfully as possible. In the second stage, another group of
	naive individuals was instructed to score each of the descriptions
	produced by the subjects in the first stage. Individual scores were
	assigned to more than a hundred different attributes. We show that
	within a single glance, much object- and scene-level information
	is perceived by human subjects. The richness of our perception, though,
	seems asymmetrical. Subjects tend to have a propensity toward perceiving
	natural scenes as being outdoor rather than indoor. The reporting
	of sensory- or feature-level information of a scene (such as shading
	and shape) consistently precedes the reporting of the semantic-level
	information. But once subjects recognize more semantic-level components
	of a scene, there is little evidence suggesting any bias toward either
	scene-level or object-level recognition.},

	25, D-53105, Bonn, Germany. juergen.fell@ukb.uni-bonn.de Today, much
	evidence exists that sensory feature binding is accomplished by phase
	synchronization of induced neuronal gamma activity (30-80 Hz). Recent
	studies furthermore suggest that phase synchronization of induced
	gamma activity may represent a general mechanism enabling transient
	associations of neural assemblies and thus may play a central role
	in cortical information processing. Here, we describe findings indicating
	that synchronized gamma activity is moreover specifically involved
	in selective attention. While feature binding appears to depend primarily
	on induced gamma synchronization, attentional processes seem to involve
	both induced and evoked gamma oscillations. Yet it is still an open
	question, as to which top-down and bottom-up processes are associated
	with attentional modulation of gamma activity. A possible mechanism
	to project influences from attentional control structures to areas
	concerned with stimulus representation and vice versa, may be neuronal
	synchronization and the resulting firing rate changes of coincidence-detecting
	neurons in target areas. }

	 The appearance of oscillatory modes of 'gamma' activity in many cortical
	areas of different species has generated interest in understanding
	their underlying mechanisms and possible functions. This paper reviews
	evidence from studies on primate motor cortex showing that oscillatory
	activity entrains many neurons during periods of exploratory manipulative
	behavior. These oscillatory episodes synchronize widely spread neurons
	in sensorimotor cortex bilaterally, including descending corticospinal
	neurons, as evidenced by correlated modulations in EMG activity.
	The resulting neural synchronization involves task-related and -unrelated
	neurons similarly, suggesting that it is more likely to play some
	global role in attention than mediating any obvious interactions
	involved in coordinating movements. Intracellular recordings have
	elucidated the strength and types of synaptic interactions between
	motor cortical neurons that are involved in both normal and oscillatory
	activity. Spike-triggered averages (STAs) of intracellular membrane
	potentials have revealed serial connections in the form of unitary
	excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs).
	More commonly, STAs showed large synchronous excitatory or inhibitory
	potentials (ASEPs and ASIPs) beginning before the trigger spike and
	composed of multiple unitary events. ASEPs involved synchronous activity
	in a larger and more widespread group of presynaptic neurons than
	ASIPs. During oscillatory episodes synchronized excitatory and inhibitory
	synaptic potentials occurred in varying proportions. EPSPs evoked
	by stimulating neighboring cortical sites during the depolarizing
	phase of spontaneous oscillations showed evidence of transient potentiation.
	These observations are consistent with several functional hypotheses,
	but fit best with a possible role in attention or arousal.},

	that the left hemisphere is biased towards local and the right towards
	global processing, The underlying attentional and perceptual mechanisms
	are maximally impaired by unilateral lesions to the temporal and

	In a directed attention task, early visual processing (prestriate)
	areas were activated: attention to the global aspect of the figures
	activated the right lingual gyrus whereas locally directed attention
	activated the left inferior occipital cortex. In a subsequent divided
	attention task, the number of target switches from local to global
	(and vice versa) covaried with temporal-parietal activation, The

	with sharp electrode recordings in slices of guinea-pig parietal
	cortex and whole-cell patch recordings of mouse somatosensory cortex.
	Repetitive intracellular stimulation with 1 s depolarizing pulses
	delivered at intervals of < 5 s caused slow, cumulative adaptation
	of spike firing, which was not associated with a change in resting
	conductance, and which persisted when Co2+ replaced Ca2+ in the bathing
	medium. 2. Development of slow cumulative adaptation was associated
	with a gradual decrease in maximal rates of rise of action potentials,
	a slowing in the post-spike depolarization towards threshold, and
	a positive shift in the threshold voltage for the next spike in the
	train; maximal spike repolarization rates and after-hyperpolarizations
	were unchanged. 3. The data suggested that slow adaptation reflects
	use-dependent removal of Naf channels from the available pool by
	an inactivation process which is much slower than fast, Hodgkin-Huxley-type
	inactivation. 4. We therefore studied the properties or Na+ channels
	in layer II-III mouse neocortical cells using the cell-attached configuration
	of the patch-in-slice technique. These had a slope conductance of
	18 +/- 1 pS and an extrapolated reversal potential of 127 +/- 6 mV
	above resting potential (V-r) (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 5). V-r was estimated
	at -72 +/- 3 mV (n = 8), based on the voltage dependence of the steady-state
	inactivation (h(infinity)) curve. 5. Slow inactivation (SI) of Na+
	channels had a mono-exponential onset with r(on) between 0.86 and
	2.33 s (n = 3). Steady-state SI was half-maximal at -43.8 mV and
	had a slope of 14.4 mV (e-fold)(-1). Recovery from a 2 s conditioning
	pulse was bi-exponential and voltage dependent; the slow time constant
	ranged between 0.45 and 2.5 s at voltages between -128 and -68 mV.
	6. The experimentally determined parameters of SI were adequate to
	simulate slow cumulative adaptation of spike firing in a single-compartment
	computer model. 7. Persistent Na+ current, which was recorded in
	whole-cell configuration during slow voltage ramps (35 mV s(-1)),
	also underwent pronounced SI, which was apparent when the ramp was
	preceded by a prolonged depolarizing pulse.},

	the eye movements of participants were recorded while they viewed
	color photographs of natural scenes in preparation for a memory test
	(encoding) and when recognizing them later. These eye movements were
	then compared to the predictions of a well defined saliency map model
	(L. Itti & C. Koch, 2000), in terms of both individual fixation locations
	and fixation sequences (scanpaths). The saliency model is a significantly
	better predictor of fixation location than random models that take
	into account bias toward central fixations, and this is the case
	at both encoding and recognition. However, similarity between scanpaths
	made at multiple viewings of the same stimulus suggests that repetitive
	scanpaths also contribute to where people look. Top-down recapitulation
	of scanpaths is a key prediction of scanpath theory (D. Noton & L.
	Stark, 1971), but it might also be explained by bottom-up guidance.
	The present data suggest that saliency cannot account for scanpaths
	and that incorporating these sequences could improve model predictions.}

  abstract = {Department of Physics, Group of Neurophysics, Philipps University,
	Renthof 7, D-35032 Marburg, Germany. It has been argued that coupling
	among the neural signals activated by a visual object supports binding
	of local features into a coherent object perception. During visual
	stimulation by a grating texture we studied functional coupling by
	calculating spectral coherence among pairs of signals recorded in
	the striate cortex of awake monkeys. Multiple unit activity (MUA)
	and local field potentials (LFP, 1-140 Hz) were extracted from seven
	parallel broad band recordings. Spectral coherence was dominated
	by high-frequency oscillations in the range 35-50 Hz and often by
	additional low-frequency components (0-12 Hz). Functional coupling
	among separate cortical sites was more stimulus specific for MUA
	than for LFP: MUA coherence at high and low frequencies depended
	highly significantly on: (i) the similarity of the preferred orientations
	at the two sites - the more similar the higher the coherence; (ii)
	the orientation of the stimulus grating - with highest coherence
	at half angle between the preferred orientations at the two sites;
	(iii) cortical distance - coherence decreases to noise levels at
	approximately 3 mm (MUA) and 6 mm (LFP). Coherence of fast oscillations
	did not depend on the degree of coaxiality of the orientation-sensitive
	receptive fields, whereas low frequencies showed significant dependency.
	This indicates that different frequency components can engage different
	coupling networks in the striate cortex which probably support different
	coding tasks. Changes in average oscillation frequency with stimulus
	orientation were highly significant for fast oscillations while there
	was no dependency for low frequencies. Finally, stimulus-related
	spectral power and coherence of fast oscillations were considerably
	higher than of low frequency components. Fast oscillations may therefore
	contribute more to feature binding and coding of object continuity
	than low-frequency components, at least for texture surfaces as analysed
	here.}

  abstract = { In crowded visual scenes, attention biases processing in favor of
	relevant stimuli by enhancing the competitive advantage of neurons
	driven by those stimuli. We hypothesized that this is achieved through
	a modulation of neuronal synchronization. For area V4, we recently
	found that attention indeed causes synchronization between spikes
	and local field potentials (LFPs) to be enhanced in the gamma band
	and reduced for low frequencies (Fries et al., Science, 2001). However,
	we failed to show the same for spike-spike synchronization using
	conventional methods. We have now applied multi-taper spectral methods
	to the data, which have improved sensitivity, and in addition we
	performed recordings in V1. Multi-units and LFP were recorded from
	multiple electrodes in either V1 or V4. One patch of moving grating
	was in the area of receptive field (RF) overlap while a second was
	outside the RF. Monkeys were cued to attend to one stimulus to detect
	a change occurring at random time, while ignoring changes in the
	other stimulus. Coherence was calculated between either two spike-
	or one spike- and one LFP-recording. In V1 and V4, attention enhanced
	firing rates. In V1, increases were small but significant for many
	sites. In both areas, spike-field and spike-spike coherence were
	dominated by a broad peak between 30 and 70 Hz, i.e. the gamma-frequency
	range. In V4, attention enhanced both spike-field and spike-spike
	synchronization in the gamma band while reducing synchronization
	at low frequencies, and these effects were significant for many individual
	pairs. In V1, there was no significant effect of attention at the
	population level, but many individual pairs showed either significant
	increases or decreases in gamma band coherence. Thus, while enhanced
	gamma-band coherence for attended stimuli is likely to enhance the
	downstream impact of V4 neurons, its role in V1 remains unclear.}

	 Biologically relevant sounds such as speech, animal vocalizations

	in the field of auditory neuroscience in the past three decades,
	it is not possible to review all progress in this field in a single
	article. The goal of the present report is to focus on single-unit
	mechanisms in the mammalian brainstem auditory system for encoding
	AM and gaps as illustrative examples of how the system encodes key
	temporal features of sound. This report, following a systems analysis
	approach, starts with findings in the auditory nerve and proceeds
	centrally through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex
	and inferior colliculus. Some general principles can be seen when
	reviewing this entire field. For example, as one ascends the central
	auditory system, a neural encoding shift occurs. An emphasis on synchronous
	responses for temporal coding exists in the auditory periphery, and
	more reliance on rate coding occurs as one moves centrally. In addition,
	for AM, modulation transfer functions become more bandpass as the
	sound level of the signal is raised, but become more lowpass in shape
	as background noise is added. In many cases, AM coding can actually
	increase in the presence of background noise. For gap processing
	or forward masking, coding for gaps changes from a decrease in spike
	firing rate for neurons of the peripheral auditory system that have
	sustained response patterns, to an increase in firing rate for more
	central neurons with transient responses. Lastly, for gaps and forward
	masking, as one ascends the auditory system, some suppression effects
	become quite long (echo suppression), and in some stimulus configurations
	enhancement to a second sound can take place.}

	they were asked to attend to the visual signals and ignore the tones.
	Activity in primary auditory cortex and adjacent areas was strongly
	correlated with rate of tone presentation, but this relationship
	was not affected by the direction of attention. In only one area,
	the right midthalamus, was the response to tones modulated by attention.
	In this area responses to tones occurred when attention was directed
	to sound, but not when attention was directed to visual stimuli.
	There is considerable evidence that the EEG evoked response to tones
	(N100/Nd response) is strongly modulated by attention and arises
	in auditory cortex. The ERP is the sum of activity from many sources.
	The amplitude of this response reflects not only the amount of activity
	in these sources, but also the degree of synchrony between them.
	The difference between these typical ERP results and our result from
	PET could be resolved if we assume that, in our paradigm, attention
	did not increase the amount of neural activity in auditory cortex,
	but rather the degree of synchrony between many sources. The signal
	in the thalamus, which we observed only when volunteers were attending
	to the tones, might provide the basis for this synchrony.},

  abstract = {Acoustic filter properties of A1 neurons can dynamically adapt to
	stimulus statistics, classical conditioning, instrumental learning
	and the changing auditory attentional focus. We have recently developed
	an experimental paradigm that allows us to view cortical receptive
	field plasticity on-line as the animal meets different behavioral
	challenges by attending to salient acoustic cues and changing its
	cortical filters to enhance performance. We propose that attention
	is the key trigger that initiates a cascade of events leading to
	the dynamic receptive field changes that we observe. In our paradigm,
	ferrets were initially trained, using conditioned avoidance training
	techniques, to discriminate between background noise stimuli (temporally
	orthogonal ripple combinations) and foreground tonal target stimuli.
	They learned to generalize the task for a wide variety of distinct
	background and foreground target stimuli. We recorded cortical activity
	in the awake behaving animal and computed on-line spectrotemporal
	receptive fields (STRFs) of single neurons in A1. We observed clear,
	predictable task-related changes in STRF shape while the animal performed
	spectral tasks (including single tone and multi-tone detection, and
	two-tone discrimination) with different tonal targets. A different
	set of task-related changes occurred when the animal performed temporal
	tasks (including gap detection and click-rate discrimination). Distinctive
	cortical STRF changes may constitute a 'task-specific signature'.
	These spectral and temporal changes in cortical filters occur quite
	rapidly, within 2min of task onset, and fade just as quickly after
	task completion, or in some cases, persisted for hours. The same
	cell could multiplex by differentially changing its receptive field
	in different task conditions. On-line dynamic task-related changes,
	as well as persistent plastic changes, were observed at a single-unit,
	multi-unit and population level. Auditory attention is likely to
	be pivotal in mediating these task-related changes since the magnitude
	of STRF changes correlated with behavioral performance on tasks with
	novel targets. Overall, these results suggest the presence of an
	attention-triggered plasticity algorithm in A1 that can swiftly change
	STRF shape by transforming receptive fields to enhance figure/ground
	separation, by using a contrast matched filter to filter out the
	background, while simultaneously enhancing the salient acoustic target
	in the foreground. These results favor the view of a nimble, dynamic,
	attentive and adaptive brain that can quickly reshape its sensory
	filter properties and sensori-motor links on a moment-to-moment basis,
	depending upon the current challenges the animal faces. In this review,
	we summarize our results in the context of a broader survey of the
	field of auditory attention, and then consider neuronal networks
	that could give rise to this phenomenon of attention-driven receptive
	field plasticity in A1.}

	during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative
	changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory
	changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target
	tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target

	extracellular recording and stimulation paradigm that extends the
	duration of single-neuron electrophysiological experiments, exposing
	the dynamics of excitability in individual cultured cortical neurons
	over timescales hitherto inaccessible. We show that the long-term
	neuronal excitability dynamics is unstable and dominated by critical
	fluctuations, intermittency, scale-invariant rate statistics, and
	long memory. These intrinsic dynamics bound the firing rate over
	extended timescales, contrasting observed short-term neuronal response
	to stimulation onset. Furthermore, the activity of a neuron over
	extended timescales shows transitions between quasi-stable modes,
	each characterized by a typical response pattern. Like in the case
	of rate statistics, the short-term onset response pattern that often
	serves to functionally define a given neuron is not indicative of
	its long-term ongoing response. These observations question the validity
	of describing neuronal excitability based on temporally restricted
	electrophysiological data, calling for in-depth exploration of activity
	over wider temporal scales. Such extended experiments will probably
	entail a different kind of neuronal models, accounting for the unbounded

  abstract = {Functional MRI was used to test whether instructing subjects to attend
	to one or another location in a visual scene would affect neural
	activity in human primary visual cortex. Stimuli were moving gratings
	restricted to a pair of peripheral, circular apertures, positioned
	to the right and to the left of a central fixation point. Subjects
	were trained to perform a motion discrimination task, attending (without
	moving their eyes) at any moment to one of the two stimulus apertures.
	Functional MRI responses were recorded while subjects were cued to
	alternate their attention between the two apertures. Primary visual
	cortex responses in each hemisphere modulated with the alternation
	of the cue; responses were greater when the subject attended to the
	stimuli in the contralateral hemifield. The attentional modulation
	of the brain activity was about 25% of that evoked by alternating
	the stimulus with a uniform field. }

	the 100-150-ms range were studied under conditions where attention
	was directed either toward or away from the probe stimulus. An N120
	component, not sensitive to spatial attention, appeared in all conditions,
	including the no-task condition. Its distribution was consistent
	with an origin in the second somatic area. A later N140 response,
	not recorded in neutral conditions, was highly sensitive to spatial
	attention and reached its maximum to stimulation of the attended
	hand; its behavior was consistent with that of a processing negativity.
	The N140 was bilaterally distributed, but the hemisphere contralateral
	to stimulation appeared to be involved earlier than the ipsilateral
	one. Although the exogenous N120 may be influenced by somatosensory
	awareness and perhaps tactile recognition, the N140 appears linked
	to the spatial components of attention and results from the activation
	of several areas in both hemispheres.}

	Localization of the target is relatively preserved but it quantitatively

  abstract = {The role of target salience in crowding has remained controversial
	largely because salience usually escapes objective measurement. Here
	we address this problem using search efficiency as a measure of target
	salience. In separate experiments observers determined whether parafoveal
	arrays of vertical Gabor patterns contained targets having a unique
	colour, a unique direction of motion, and a unique temporal frequency.
	We analysed search efficiency in the conventional manner using reaction-time
	gradients (in seconds per item). We also considered accuracy gradients
	(in percent-correct per item). Crowding is typically quantified by
	comparing the acuity for a target within an array to the acuity for
	a target presented alone. We measured orientation acuity for determining
	whether a slightly tilted target was clockwise or anticlockwise of
	vertical. Targets with a unique colour or direction of motion were
	found to pop out, ie (with one exception) reaction-time and accuracy
	gradients were insignificantly different from zero. Acuity for these
	targets was significantly greater than acuity for targets whose neighbours
	had the same colour and direction of motion. Manipulation of temporal
	frequency produced a wide range of search efficiencies. For three
	of four observers we found a linear relationship between acuity and
	the accuracy gradient, shallow gradients being associated with high
	acuity. In general, we find that crowding is weakened when observers
	can find a parafoveally presented target quickly and accurately.}

  abstract = {History-dependent characteristic time scales in dynamics have been
	observed at several levels of organization in neural systems. Such
	dynamics can provide powerful means for computation and memory. At
	the level of the single neuron, several microscopic mechanisms, including
	ion channel kinetics, can support multiple-time-scale dynamics. How
	the temporally complex channel kinetics gives rise to dynamical properties
	of the neuron is not well understood. Here, we construct a model
	that captures some features of the connection between these two levels
	of organization. The model neuron exhibits history-dependent multiple-time-scale
	dynamics in several effects: first, after stimulation, the recovery
	time scale is related to the stimulation duration by a power-law
	scaling; second, temporal patterns of neural activity in response
	to ongoing stimulation are modulated over time; finally, the characteristic
	time scale for adaptation after a step change in stimulus depends
	on the duration of the preceding stimulus. All these effects have
	been observed experimentally and are not explained by current single-neuron
	models. The model neuron here presented is composed of an ensemble
	of ion channels that can wander in a large pool of degenerate inactive
	states and thus exhibits multiple-time-scale dynamics at the molecular
	level. Channel inactivation rate depends on recent neural activity,
	which in turn depends through modulations of the neural response
	function on the fraction of active channels. This construction produces
	a model that robustly exhibits nonexponential history-dependent dynamics,
	in qualitative agreement with experimental results.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an application of VRML-based multimedia to the
	domain of spatial cognition experiments. Typically, such experiments
	involve human subjects that are presented with graphical stimuli
	in a laboratory setup. Larger numbers of subjects and stimuli give
	more weight to the outcomes of the experiment, but in practice the
	number of subjects is limited by practicalities like time constraints.
	This paper describes a way to overcome this limitation: use the internet
	to bring the experiment to the subject instead of the other way around.
	We are developing a web page with psychophysical experiments, using
	VRML as a means for presenting three-dimensional graphics to simulate
	the conditions of a laboratory experiment. While using the web for
	psychological experiments is not a novel idea, combining that with
	VRML is new and extends the possibilities for experiments. In this
	paper we outline the power of using the web and describe an experiment
	using VRML, highlighting technical aspects of the problems encountered
	and the solutions taken to overcome them.},

	Gamma-band oscillations are related to sensory information processing
	and attention. To further illuminate the relationship of gamma-band
	activity and selective somatic attention, we have studied the effects
	of direction of attention on the stimuli of somatosensory evoked
	potentials. Responses during focused attention to stimulation of
	the right median nerve and ignored stimulation at the right tibial
	nerve were compared with responses of ignored stimulation of the
	right median nerve but focused attention to stimulation at the right
	tibial nerve. Subtraction of the data demonstrated a significant
	predominantly right hemispheric event-related synchronization in
	the gamma-band by attention to the right median nerve in the time
	period between 280 and 325 ms post-stimulus. This finding implicates
	the involvement of a right temporoparietal network in selective spatial
	attention. }

  journal = jnphysiol,
  year = {1994},
  volume = {71},
  pages = {2325-2337},
  abstract = { 1. Isolated, single-neuron extracellular potentials were recorded
	sequentially in area TE of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) of two
	macaque monkeys (n = 58 and n = 41 neurons). Data were obtained while
	the animals were performing a paired-associate task. The task utilized
	five stimuli and eight stimulus pairings (4 correct and 4 incorrect).
	Data were evaluated as average spike rate during experimental epochs
	of 100 or 400 ms. Single-unit and population characteristics were
	measured using a form of linear discriminant analysis and information
	theoretic measures. To evaluate the significance of covariance on
	population code measures, additional data consisting of simultaneous
	recordings from less than or equal to 8 isolated neurons(n = 37)
	were obtained from a third macaque monkey that was passively viewing
	visual stimuli. 2. On average, 43% of IT neurons were activated by
	any of the stimuli used (60% if those inhibited also are included).
	Yet the neurons were rather unique in the relative magnitude of their
	responses to each stimulus in the test set. These results suggest
	that information may be represented in IT by the pattern of activity
	across neurons and that the representation is not sparsely coded.
	It is further suggested that the representation scheme may have similarities
	to DNA or computer codes wherein a coding element is not a local
	parametric descriptor. This is a departure from the V1 representation,
	which appears to be both local and parametric. It is also different
	from theories of IT representation that suggest a constructive basis
	set or ''alphabet''. From this view, determination of stimurus discrimination
	capacity in IT should be evaluated by measures of population activity
	patterns. 3. Evaluation of small groups of simultaneously recorded
	neurons obtained during a fixation task suggests that little information
	about visual stimuli is conveyed by covariance of activity in IT
	when a 100-ms time scale is used as in this study. This finding is
	consistent with a prior report, by Gochin et al., which used a I-ms
	time scare and failed to find neural activity coherence or oscillations
	dependent on stimuli. 4. Population-stimulus-discrimination capacity
	measures were influenced by the number of neurons and to some extent
	the number and type of stimuli. 5. Information conveyed by individual
	neurons (mutual information) averaged 0.26 bits. The distribution
	of information values was uni-modal and is therefore more consistent
	with a distributed than a local coding scheme. Populations of neurons
	conveyed less information than the sum of the individuals, reaching
	<1.9 bits for similar to 50 neurons, thus indicating considerable
	redundancy. The novelty of information was found to be a function
	of the size of the population sample, apparently decreasing by 1/root
	n. 6. Information available through the course of the behavioral
	paradigm was evaluated by partitioning the data into 100-ms epochs.
	The results indicate that a relatively large amount of information
	becomes available in the second 100 ms after stimulus onset. The
	peak in information occurs between 200 and 400 ms after stimulus
	onset and significantly decays before the stimulus is removed. By
	the time the second stimulus was shown in our paired associates paradigm
	(500 ms after stimulus 1 offset), information about the first stimulus
	was about half of the peak value.},

	in the cued position), an invalid condition (stimulus presented in

	(no information on stimulus position). The most interesting result
	was the demonstration that attention can be moved along the sagittal
	plane in the absence of vergence eye movements and that when attention
	is focused on a certain point, unattended points between this point
	and the observer (i.e. near points) are responded faster than unattended
	points beyond it (i.e. far points). In the frontal plane no asymmetry
	was found between the responses to unattended points above or below
	the fixation, whereas a certain, albeit non-constant, advantage was
	present for unattended stimuli on the right of the fixation point
	in respect to those on the left of it. The second series of experiments
	was similar to the first one, except that a new situation was introduced
	in which the fixation point was cued and stimuli could appear either
	in correspondence to it or in a peripheral position (invalid condition
	with attention at the fixation point). The results showed that in
	this new situation the responses to unattended stimuli are much longer
	than they are under neutral conditions, and as long as they are under
	conventional invalid condition. It is suggested that the so called
	neutral condition is a condition of diffuse attention and an attempt
	is made to explain it in terms of a premotor theory of attention.}

  abstract = {Little is known about the physiology of neurons in Caenorhabditis
	elegans. Using new techniques for in situ patch-clamp recording in
	C. elegans, we analyzed the electrical properties of an identified
	sensory neuron (ASER) across four developmental stages and 42 unidentified
	neurons at one stage. We find that ASER is nearly isopotential and
	fails to generate classical Na+ action potentials. Rather, ASER displays
	a high sensitivity to input currents coupled to a depolarization-dependent
	reduction in sensitivity that may endow ASER with a wide dynamic
	range. Voltage clamp revealed depolarization-activated K+ and Ca2+
	currents that contribute to high sensitivity near the zero-current
	potential. The depolarization-dependent reduction in sensitivity
	can be attributed to activation of K+ current at voltages where it
	dominates the net membrane current. The voltage dependence of membrane
	current was similar in all neurons examined, suggesting that C. elegans
	neurons share a common mechanism of sensitivity and dynamic range.}

  abstract = {For a neuroscientist, consciousness currently defies any formal operational
	definition. However, the phenomenon is distinct from self-consciousness:
	after all, one can 'let oneself go,' when experiencing extreme emotion,
	but still be accessing a sentiment, subjective, conscious state.
	This raw, basic subjective state does not appear to be an exclusive
	property of the human brain. There is no obvious qualitative transformation
	in either the anatomy or the physiology of the central nervous system
	of human or non-human animals, no phylogenetic Rubicon in the animal
	kingdom. Similarly, there is no clear ontogenetic line that is crossed
	as the brain grows in the womb, no single event or change in brain
	physiology, and certainly not at birth, when consciousness might
	be generated in an all-or-none fashion. A more plausible, and scientific,
	view of consciousness might be therefore that it is not a different
	property of the brain, some magic bullet, but that it is a consequence
	of a quantitative increase in the complexity of the human brain:
	consciousness will grow as brains grow. Hence, consciousness is most
	likely to be a continuously variable property of the brain, in both
	phylogenetic and ontogenetic terms. Here, we describe how modern
	techniques may be utilized to determine the physiological basis of
	consciousness.}

  abstract = {How do the laminar circuits of visual cortical areas V1 and V2 implement
	context-sensitive binding processes such as perceptual grouping and
	attention, and how do these circuits develop and learn in a stable
	way? Recent neural models clarify how preattentive and attentive
	perceptual mechanisms are intimately linked within the laminar circuits
	of visual cortex, notably how bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal
	cortical connections interact within the cortical layers. These laminar
	circuits allow the responses of visual cortical neurons to be influenced,
	not only by the stimuli within their classical receptive fields,
	but also by stimuli in the extra-classical surround. Such context-sensitive
	visual processing can greatly enhance the analysis of visual scenes,
	especially those containing targets that are low contrast, partially
	occluded, or crowded by distractors. Attentional enhancement can
	selectively propagate along groupings of both real and illusory contours,
	thereby showing how attention can selectively enhance object representations.
	Recent models explain how attention may have a stronger facilitatory
	effect on low contrast than on high contrast stimuli, and how pop-out
	from orientation contrast may occur. The specific functional roles
	which the model proposes for the cortical layers allow several testable
	neurophysiological predictions to be made. Model mechanisms clarify
	how intracortical and intercortical feedback help to stabilize cortical
	development and learning. Although feedback plays a key role, fast
	feedforward processing is possible in response to unambiguous information.
	Model circuits are capable of synchronizing quickly, but context-sensitive
	persistence of previous events can influence how synchrony develops.}

  abstract = {Recent neurophysiological studies have shown that primary visual cortex,
	or V1, does more than passively process image features using the
	feedforward filters suggested by Hubel and Wiesel. It also uses horizontal
	interactions to group features preattentively into object representations,
	and feedback interactions to selectively attend to these groupings.
	All neocortical areas, including V1, are organized into layered circuits.
	We present a neural model showing how the layered circuits in areas
	V1 and V2 enable feedforward, horizontal, and feedback interactions
	to complete perceptual groupings over positions that do not receive
	contrastive visual inputs, even while attention can only modulate
	or prime positions that do not receive such inputs. Recent neurophysiological
	data about how grouping and attention occur and interact in V1 are
	simulated and explained, and testable predictions are made. These
	simulations show how attention can selectively propagate along an
	object grouping and protect it from competitive masking, and how
	contextual stimuli can enhance or suppress groupings in a contrast-sensitive
	manner.}

	modulation of gamma band responses in a visual spatial attention
	task using a 128-channel-EEG-montage. METHODS: Colored rectangles
	were presented on a screen. After 500 ms an arrow indicated whether
	subjects had to shift their attention to the left or right half of
	the screen to detect target stimuli. During the task, either the
	attended half of the screen rotated horizontally while the unattended
	part remained motionless, or vice versa. RESULTS: When subjects attended
	the rotating stimulus, we found significantly higher power in a specific
	gamma band from 35-51 Hz on parieto-occipital electrode sites contralateral
	to the stimulation side. In addition, after the onset of the arrow
	which indicated what side subjects should direct their attention
	to, the 35-51 Hz response shifted from a broad posterior distribution
	to an increase of power at parieto-occipital sites contralateral
	to the to-be-attended side. Furthermore, the rotating stimulus elicited
	higher gamma band power as compared to the standing stimulus at electrode
	locations, which may be related to the activity of underlying cortical
	structures specialized for motion processing. CONCLUSIONS: The present
	results replicate important parts of previous findings of enhanced
	gamma power when a moving stimulus was attended.}

	opponent (CO) cells at early stages of the visual pathway are known
	to respond to chromatic flicker at frequencies far exceeding the
	perceptual fusion frequency. To explain color fusion, several groups
	have predicted that CO cells in V1-unlike the retina and lateral
	geniculate nucleus-should not follow high-frequency flicker. To test
	this prediction we recorded from 12 CO cells in various V1 layers.
	We found, contrary to expectations, that these neurons follow high
	frequency flicker well above heterochromatic fusion frequencies.
	All followed 15 Hz flicker and 10/12 followed 30 Hz flicker. For
	three cells, we tested 60 Hz luminance flicker and found clear responses.
	We thus present evidence of cortical activity in alert, trained monkeys
	that is clearly representing visual stimulation, yet is not perceived.
	Our data call into question explanations of perceptual phenomena
	that invoke a low temporal frequency cut-off of CO cells in V1 to
	account for the failure to perceive fast temporal changes in the

	cortical functions. We recorded neuronal activity in the frontal
	cortex of behaving monkeys and found that temporal coincidences of
	spikes firing of different neurons can emerge within a fraction of
	a second in relation to the animal behavior. The temporal patterns
	of the correlation could not be predicted from the modulations of
	the neurons firing rate and finally, the patterns of correlation
	depend on the distance between neurons. These findings call for a
	revision of prevailing models of neural coding that solely rely on
	firing rates. The findings suggest that modification of neuronal
	interactions can serve as a mechanism by which neurons associate
	rapidly into a functional group in order to perform a specific computational
	task. Increased correlation between members of the groups, and decreased
	or negative correlation with others, enhance the ability to dissociate
	one group from concurrently activated competing groups. Such modulation
	of neuronal interactions allows each neuron to become a member of
	several different groups and participate in different computational

  volume = {3},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {Neurons in cortical slices emit spikes or bursts of spikes regularly
	in response to a suprathreshold current injection. This behavior
	is in marked contrast to the behavior of cortical neurons in vivo,
	whose response to electrical or sensory input displays a strong degree
	of irregularity. Correlation measurements show a significant degree
	of synchrony in the temporal fluctuations of neuronal activities
	in cortex. We explore the hypothesis that these phenomena are the
	result of the synchronized chaos generated by the deterministic dynamics
	of local cortical networks. A model of a ''hypercolumn'' in the visual
	cortex is studied. It consists of two populations of neurons, one
	inhibitory and one excitatory. The dynamics of the neurons is based
	on a Hodgkin-Huxley type model of excitable voltage-clamped cells
	with several cellular and synaptic conductances. A slow potassium
	current is included in the dynamics of the excitatory population
	to reproduce the observed adaptation of the spike trains emitted
	by these neurons. The pattern of connectivity has a spatial structure
	which is correlated with the internal organization of hypercolumns
	in orientation columns. Numerical simulations of the model show that
	in an appropriate parameter range, the network settles in a synchronous
	chaotic state, characterized by a strong temporal variability of
	the neural activity which is correlated across the hypercolumn. Strong
	inhibitory feedback is essential for the stabilization of this state.
	These results show that the cooperative dynamics of large neuronal
	networks are capable of generating variability and synchrony similar
	to those observed in cortex. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation
	functions of neuronal spike trains are computed, and their temporal
	and spatial features are analyzed. In other parameter regimes, the
	network exhibits two additional states: synchronized oscillations
	and an asynchronous state. We use our model to study cortical mechanisms
	for orientation selectivity. It is shown that in a suitable parameter
	regime, when the input is not oriented, the network has a continuum
	of states, each representing an inhomogeneous population activity
	which is peaked at one of the orientation columns. As a result, when
	a weakly oriented input stimulates the network, it yields a sharp
	orientation tuning. The properties of the network in this regime,
	including the appearance of virtual rotations and broad stimulus-dependent
	cross-correlations, are investigated. The results agree with the
	predictions of the mean field theory which was previously derived
	for a simplified model of stochastic, two-state neurons. The relation
	between the results of the model and experiments in visual cortex
	are discussed.}

	between on- and off-pathways. Based on physiological evidence we
	propose a push-pull model with dominating opponent inhibition (DOI).
	We show that the model can account for empirical data on simple cells,
	such as contrast-invariant orientation tuning, sharpening of orientation
	tuning with increasing inhibition, and strong response decrements
	to stimuli with luminance gradient reversal. With identical parameter
	settings, we apply the model for the processing of synthetic and
	real world images. We show that the model with DOI can robustly extract
	oriented contrast information from noisy input. More important, noise
	is adaptively suppressed, i.e. the model simple cells do not respond
	to homogeneous regions of different noise levels, while remaining
	sensitive to small contrast changes. The image processing results
	reveal a possible functional role of the strong inhibition as observed
	empirically, namely to adaptively suppress responses to noisy input.},

  abstract = {An unresolved question in electroencephalogram (EEG) research is whether
	event-related potentials (ERPs) are generated by phase-reset or evoked
	response. We analyzed data of a visual feature detection task and
	will show 1) phase concentration in the alpha frequency range, 2)
	ongoing alpha activity prior to stimulus onset, 3) evoked alpha oscillation
	in the ERP, 4) lack of power increase during phase concentration,
	5) decrease in amplitude variance during early evoked components
	preceding a decrease in power, and 6) the same cortical sources for
	induced prestimulus power and evoked poststimulus power. Because
	none of these data provide unequivocal evidence for phase reset,
	we additionally tested the basic assumption of the evoked model,
	which is the additivity of the evoked response on the basis of a
	simulation approach. Our findings suggest that nonadditive processes-typical
	for a phase reset-are involved in the generation of the ERP. Thus,
	together with the other findings this study provides unequivocal
	evidence for phase resetting in the human EEG.}

	commonly synchronized around the time of movement initiation. For
	some cell pairs, synchrony varied with direction in a manner not
	readily predicted by the firing of either neuron. Information theoretic
	analysis demonstrated quantitatively that synchrony provides information

	Thus, MI neurons are not simply independent encoders of movement
	parameters but rather engage in mutual interactions that could potentially
	provide an additional coding dimension in cortex.}

  abstract = {VISUAL-SPATIAL attention is an essential brain function that enables
	us to select and preferentially process high priority information
	in the visual fields. Several brain areas have been shown to participate
	in the control of spatial attention in humans(3-5), but little is
	known about the underlying selection mechanisms. Non-invasive scalp
	recordings of event-related potentials (e.r.ps) in humans have shown
	that attended visual stimuli are preferentially selected as early
	as 80-90 ms after stimulus onset(6,7), but current e.r.p. methods
	do not permit a- precise localization of the participating cortical
	areas. In this study we combined neuroimaging (positron emission
	tomography) with e.r.p. recording in order to describe both the cortical
	anatomy and time course of attentional selection processes. Together
	these methods showed that visual inputs from attended locations receive
	enhanced processing in the extrastriate cortex (fusiform gyrus) at
	80-130 ms after stimulus onset. These findings reinforce early selection
	models of attention(8-10).},

	Neuronal response synchronization with millisecond precision has
	been proposed to serve feature binding in vision and should therefore,
	like visual experience, depend on central states. Here we test this
	hypothesis by examining the occurrence and strength of response synchronization
	in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats as a function of central
	states. These were assessed from the frequency content of the electroencephalogram,
	low power in the delta and high power in the gamma frequency ranges
	(here 20-70 Hz) being considered as a signature of activated states.
	We evaluated both spontaneous state changes and transitions induced
	by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation.
	During states of low central activation, visual responses were robust
	but lacked signs of precise synchronization. At intermediate levels
	of activation, responses became synchronized and exhibited an oscillatory
	patterning in the range of 70-105 Hz. At higher levels of activation,
	a different pattern of response synchronization and oscillatory modulation
	appeared, oscillation frequency now being in the range of 20-65 Hz.
	The strength of response synchronization and oscillatory modulation
	in the 20-65 Hz range increased with further activation and was associated
	with a decrease in oscillation frequency. We propose that the oscillatory
	patterning in the 70-105 Hz range is attributable to oscillatory
	retinothalamic input and that a minimal level of activation is necessary
	for cortical neurons to follow this oscillatory pattern. In contrast,
	the synchronization of responses at oscillation frequencies in the
	20-65 Hz range appears to result from intracortical synchronizing
	mechanisms, which become progressively more effective as central
	activation increases. Surprisingly, enhanced synchronization and
	oscillatory modulation in the gamma frequency range were not associated
	with consistent increases in response amplitude, excluding a simple
	relation between central activation and neuronal discharge rate.
	The fact that intracortical synchronizing mechanisms are particularly
	effective during states of central activation supports the hypothesis
	that precise synchronization of responses plays a role in sensory
	processing.},

  journal = jneuro,

  volume = {17},
  pages = {6391-400},
  abstract = {Humans and monkeys have similar capacities to discriminate the frequencies
	of mechanical sinusoids delivered to their hands in the range that
	corresponds to the sense of flutter (10-50 Hz). Previous studies
	showed that monkeys can discriminate whether comparison stimuli are
	higher or lower in frequency than a base stimulus that does not vary
	from trial to trial during an experiment. We verified this result
	in two monkeys trained in this manner. To confirm that these animals
	were able to discriminate, we tested them in a variant of the task
	in which the frequency of the base stimulus changed randomly from
	trial to trial. The monkeys failed to discriminate in this new testing
	mode; instead they seemed to categorize the comparison stimuli, ignoring
	the base stimulus. After further training in the randomized base
	condition, the two monkeys learned to discriminate accurately. We
	then explored how the stimulation parameters affected performance.
	We found that animals could discriminate accurately with stimulus
	durations as short as 250 msec, with interstimulus intervals as long
	as 10 sec, with 50% differences between base and comparison stimulus
	amplitudes or when stimulated on a different finger. Performance
	did not degrade in these conditions, even though the monkeys had
	never been trained or tested under them. The results show that monkeys
	may try to categorize rather than discriminate when the task allows
	either strategy, although they are capable of performing true discriminations
	very robustly. These findings have important implications for investigating
	the neuronal processes underlying sensory discrimination. Key words:

  abstract = {To determine the nature of face perception, several studies used the
	visual search paradigm, whereby subjects detect an odd target among
	distractors. When detection reaction time is set-size independent,
	the odd element is said to "pop out", reflecting a basic mechanism
	or map for the relevant feature. A number of previous studies suggested
	that schematic faces do not pop out. We show that natural face stimuli
	do pop out among assorted non-face objects. Animal faces, on the
	other hand, do not pop out from among the same assorted non-face
	objects. In addition, search for a face among distractors of another
	object category is easier than the reverse search, and face search
	is mediated by holistic face characteristics, rather than by face
	parts. Our results indicate that the association of pop out with
	elementary features and lower cortical areas may be incorrect. Instead,
	face search, and indeed all feature search, may reflect high-level
	activity with generalization over spatial and other property details.}

	local features to form a unique whole object is an important issue
	in visual object recognition. We tested whether, in behaving monkeys,
	the spike correlation between pairs of inferior temporal (IT) neurons
	dynamically changes depending on the spatial configuration of the
	local features within a whole object. We prepared more than 60,000
	face-like objects (FOs) and their corresponding non-face-like objects
	(NFOs) that consisted of random arrangements of the same set of local
	features as those in FOs. The spike correlation between a pair of
	neurons was quantified by the peak height of the shift predictor-subtracted
	cross-correlogram. For both neurons of the pair, the local features
	in a whole object were determined so that they elicited as high a
	response as possible to enable a reliable cross-correlation analysis.
	We found that the FOs thus constructed elicited neuronal activities
	that were more strongly correlated than the corresponding NFOs. Firing
	rates of the same neurons did not show such a consistent bias depending
	on the feature configuration. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic
	analysis revealed that this FO dominance of spike correlation was
	robust enough to discriminate between different feature configurations
	at the population level. Spike correlation of the cell pairs exhibited
	significant FO dominance within 300 ms after stimulus onset. The
	present results suggest that feature configuration within a unique
	whole object can be reflected in the rapid modulation of spike correlation
	among a population of neurons in the IT cortex. }

	limited to animal studies. The present results demonstrate that fast

	PO Box 475, ACT 2601, Canberra, Australia. horridge@rsbs.anu.edu.au
	When vertically presented patterns are fixed in relation to the point
	of choice of the bees, the locations of areas of colour or black
	can be discriminated in the vertical direction, and in the horizontal
	direction when the bees use some mark with green contrast on which
	to stabilize. The bees can fixate on a radial pattern, a spot, or
	a ring of spots. Resolution depends on fixation, which depends on
	green contrast, but the discrimination of locations then depends
	on the photon flux at green and blue receptors. The model proposes
	that, when the eye is stabilised, a tonic channel from all receptor
	types is activated in the region of the eye that looks at the cue.
	This channel generates a perceptual space in which location, colour
	and size contribute to a signature for each cue in each eye. In other
	channels of processing, the stimulus is the phasic modulation of
	green receptors by edges, and these pathways are colour blind. When
	the patterns are composed of bars, the cues are the radial and tangential
	edges and the integrated edge orientation, irrespective of shuffling
	of locations on the target. Orientation can be detected in fuzzy
	edges with a gradient of black to white over about 60 degrees subtended
	from the point of choice. These cues correspond to the response profiles
	of large-field, phasic, coarsely tuned filters. There is no evidence
	that cues from edges have a spatial tag. The model also proposes
	that each filter for average orientation, or radial or tangential
	edges, corresponds to an ascending succession of phasic neurones.
	Each processing channel generates a perceptual space where combinations
	of related cues form signatures, and at least one signature is passed
	to memory as an index item. A pattern may generate several signatures
	but patterns are discriminated only when their signatures differ.
	In the bee there is no evidence for the re-assembly of the pattern.},

	if the relevant object is spatially extended and overlaps with other
	image components, but the cause of the delays is presently not well
	understood. In the present study, we used a curve-tracing task to
	investigate processing delays during the grouping of contour segments
	into elongated curves. Our results indicate that contour segments
	that need to be grouped together are labeled with visual attention.
	Attention gradually spreads from contour segments that were labeled
	previously to other contours that are colinear and connected to them.
	The contour-grouping task is completed as soon as attention is directed
	to the entire curve. We conclude that processing delays during contour
	grouping are caused by a time-consuming spread of visual attention.},

	Answer: only one feature value (e.g., green) per dimension, but those
	feature values can be associated (as a group) with multiple spatially
	precise locations (comprising a single labeled Boolean map). How
	can an observer voluntarily select what to access? Answer: in one
	of two ways: (a) by selecting one feature value in one dimension
	(e.g., selecting the color red) or (b) by iteratively combining the
	output of (a) with a preexisting Boolean map via the Boolean operations
	of intersection and union. Boolean map theory offers a unified interpretation
	of a wide variety of visual attention phenomena usually treated in
	separate literatures. In so doing, it also illuminates the neglected

  abstract_part1 = { giacomo@ini.phys.ethz.ch Networks of integrate and fire (I&F) neurons
	have been extensively studied using both analytical and numerical
	simulation tools[1]. An increasing number of researchers uses software
	implementations of these networks as tools for investigating the
	effect of spike timing and synchrony on the network's computational
	properties[2,3,4]. But while software simulations are effective for
	analizing networks of neurons that use rate codes, as the principal
	representation, detailed simulations of networks of spiking neurons
	is a CPU intensive process and can still require significant amount
	of simulation time. We present a set of hybrid analog/digital VLSI
	neural circuits, that allow us to overcome these problems, by exploiting
	the advantages of both highly parallel analog computation and high-speed
	asynchronous digital VLSI techniques. Specifically, we present a
	VLSI device that contains a competitive network of I&F neurons, implemented
	using analog circuits, and a communication framework for receiving
	and sending spikes off-chip, implemented using hybrid analog/digital
	circuits. The network's architecture consists of a ring of 32 neurons
	that excite a global inhibitory neuron. The inhibitory neuron in
	turn projects its output spikes back to all the excitatory neurons
	via inhibitory synapses. The excitatory neurons are recurrently connected
	to their nearest neighbours with excitatory synapses. Each neuron
	has can also be excited or inhibited via additional synaptic circuits
	that can be accessed by spikes arriving from outside the chip. Architectures
	of this type have been shown to exhibit a broad range of interesting
	computational properties[5,6]. },
  abstract_part2 = {In [5]the authors present a similar network architecture, but in which
	the neurons are modeled with simple linear threshold units. In the
	mean-rate interpretation of neural firing the network we propose
	can exhibit a winner-take-all behavior and reproduce other results
	presented in [5]. In the more realistic spiking interpretation of
	the network, the system can also produce behaviors such as adaptive
	thresholding, single-neuron winner-take-all behavior, and synchrony
	filtering. The temporal dependence of inhibition produces a variable
	selectivity to synchronous events as well as a locking behavior that
	shifts the output spikes more closely to the input ones in time.
	In addition to being a useful tool for investigating in real-time
	the computational properties of spiking networks, the chip presented
	allows us to test these spike-based computational models in real
	physical sensorimotor systems, by connecting the chip to other neuromorphic
	sensor chips (e.g. silicon retinas and cochleae) and to robotic actuators.

	showed that a positive wave appeared approximately 250 ms prior to
	the button press of the subjects, indicating perceptual reversal
	during the observation of the Necker cube figure. A basic difficulty
	in this type of study is the possible jitter in the latency of the
	button press due to the variability of the subjects' reaction time
	during a recording session. To overcome this difficulty, a pattern
	selection method based on the wavelet transform was proposed in the
	previous study. A dominant positive wavelet coefficient in the delta
	band was found to represent the perceptual-reversal-related positivity.
	In the present study, we aim to analyze the changes in the alpha
	frequency band during perceptual reversal by using the Necker cube.
	The RMS values of the alpha frequency band were measured for two
	time periods: +/- 3 SD around the mean peak latency of the perceptual-reversal-related
	positivity and a time window of the same length before the positive
	wave. We found significantly increased delta power and decreased
	alpha power during the perceptual-reversal-related positivity.}

	RATIONALE: Acute alcohol (ethanol) challenge is known to induce various
	cognitive disturbances, yet the neural basis of the effect is poorly
	known. The auditory transient evoked gamma-band (40-Hz) oscillatory
	responses have been suggested to be associated with various perceptual
	and cognitive functions in humans; however, alcohol effects on auditory
	40-Hz responses have not been investigated to date. OBJECTIVES: The
	objective of the study was to test the dose-related impact of alcohol
	on auditory transient evoked 40-Hz responses during a selective-attention
	task. METHODS: Ten healthy social drinkers ingested, in four separate
	sessions, 0.00, 0. 25, 0.50, or 0.75 g/kg of 10% (v/v) alcohol solution.
	The order of the sessions was randomized and a double-blind procedure
	was employed. During a selective attention task, 300-Hz standard
	and 330-Hz deviant tones were presented to the left ear, and 1000-Hz
	standards and 1100-Hz deviants to the right ear of the subjects (P=0.
	425 for each standard, P=0.075 for each deviant). The subjects attended
	to a designated ear, and were to detect the deviants therein while
	ignoring tones to the other ear. RESULTS: The auditory transient
	evoked 40-Hz responses elicited by both the attended and unattended
	standard tones were significantly suppressed by the 0.50 and 0.75
	g/kg alcohol doses. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol suppresses auditory transient
	evoked 40-Hz oscillations already with moderate blood alcohol concentrations.
	Given the putative role of gamma-band oscillations in cognition,
	this finding could be associated with certain alcohol-induced cognitive
	deficits. }

	target detection and search, determining those tasks that benefit
	from attention and those which can be effectively performed pre-attentively.
	We also try to determine the stage at which attentional selection
	occurs. We review electrophysiological and human brain imaging (PET,
	fMRI, MEG, SEP) studies to assess how early in the somatosensory
	processing pathway attentional modulation occurs. There is some evidence
	that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) can show attentional effects.
	However, a number of studies have suggested that there is a hierarchy
	to attentional modulation in the somatosensory system, with the greatest
	effects being observed in secondary and association areas.}

  abstract = {Department of Neuroscience and Anatomy, Milton S. Hershey Medical
	Center, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey 17033. Neuronal responses
	to hairy skin stimulation were simultaneously recorded in the ventral
	posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus and primary somatosensory
	cortex (SI) of halothane-anesthetized cats. Among 233 thalamocortical
	neuron pairs, cross-correlation analysis revealed significant interactions
	in 120 pairs. Excitatory interactions were most prevalent and included
	influences occurring exclusively in the thalamocortical (41 pairs)
	or corticothalamic (23 pairs) directions as well as multiphasic interactions
	(40 pairs) in both directions. Only 16 pairs exhibited inhibitory
	interactions and 7 of these involved multiphasic combinations of
	excitation and inhibition. In 14 of these neuron pairs, inhibition
	was exerted in the corticothalamic direction. Receptive field (RF)
	overlap between thalamic and cortical neurons varied considerably,
	and neuronal interactions were more likely for neuron pairs sharing
	large portions of their combined RFs. Computer-controlled stimulation
	was delivered to multiple RF sites but only 46% of the neuron pairs
	displayed interactions at more than one stimulation site and only
	four neuron pairs showed interactions at all stimulus positions.
	When interactions occurred at multiple stimulus sites, 40% of these
	interactions were characterized by timing shifts where the time interval
	between VPL and SI discharges varied as much as 20 ms because of
	stimulus relocation. In nine neuron pairs, systematic shifts in stimulus
	position produced reversals in the temporal sequence of thalamic
	and cortical neuronal discharges. Functional interactions between
	thalamic and cortical neurons were detected during both spontaneous
	and stimulus-induced activity. Matched-sample comparisons of connection
	strength and half-widths of thalamocortical peaks during spontaneous
	and stimulus-induced activity indicated that functional interactions
	produced by cutaneous stimulation were significantly stronger and
	had less temporal variability than those occurring spontaneously.}

  abstract = {As large-scale, detailed network modeling projects are flourishing
	in the field of computational neuroscience, it is more and more important
	to design single neuron models that not only capture qualitative
	features of real neurons but are quantitatively accurate in silico
	representations of those. Recent years have seen substantial effort
	being put in the development of algorithms for the systematic evaluation
	and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological
	data. It is however difficult to compare these methods because of
	the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such
	effort of providing the community with a standardized set of tests
	to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort
	takes the form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have
	been present in the machine learning community for some time. This
	paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place
	in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The results of
	the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from
	single or double electrode current or conductance injection is achieved
	by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire
	models with a second variable reflecting adaptation, refractoriness,
	or a dynamic threshold.},

  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {Eye movements, eye blinks, cardiac signals, muscle noise, and line
	noise present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG)
	interpretation and analysis when rejecting contaminated EEG segments
	results in an unacceptable data loss. Many methods have been proposed
	to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially those arising
	from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency
	domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG)
	recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and
	spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular
	activity mix bidirectionally, regressing out eye artifacts inevitably
	involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well.
	Regression methods become even more problematic when a good regressing
	channel is not available for each artifact source, as in the case
	of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis (PCA) has
	been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG. However,
	PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts from brain signals,
	especially when they have comparable amplitudes. Here, we propose
	a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety
	of artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by
	independent component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected
	from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively detect,
	separate, and remove contamination from a wide variety of artifactual
	sources in EEG records with results comparing favorably with those
	obtained using regression and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to
	analyze blink-related brain activity.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Electrical potentials produced by blinks and eye movements
	present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related
	potential (ERP) data interpretation and analysis, particularly for
	analysis of data from some clinical populations. Often, all epochs
	contaminated by large eye artifacts are rejected as unusable, though
	this may prove unacceptable when blinks and eye movements occur frequently.
	METHODS: Frontal channels are often used as reference signals to
	regress out eye artifacts, but inevitably portions of relevant EEG
	signals also appearing in EOG channels are thereby eliminated or
	mixed into other scalp channels. A generally applicable adaptive
	method for removing artifacts from EEG records based on blind source
	separation by independent component analysis (ICA) (Neural Computation
	7 (1995) 1129; Neural Computation 10(8) (1998) 2103; Neural Computation
	11(2) (1999) 606) overcomes these limitations. RESULTS: Results on
	EEG data collected from 28 normal controls and 22 clinical subjects
	performing a visual selective attention task show that ICA can be
	used to effectively detect, separate and remove ocular artifacts
	from even strongly contaminated EEG recordings. The results compare
	favorably to those obtained using rejection or regression methods.
	CONCLUSIONS: The ICA method can preserve ERP contributions from all
	of the recorded trials and all the recorded data channels, even when
	none of the single trials are artifact-free.}

  abstract = {GABAA-mediated IPSCs in piriform cortex have fast and slow components
	with different properties and locations on pyramidal cells. J. Neurophysiol.
	78: 2531-2545, 1997. A recent study in piriform (olfactory) cortex
	provided evidence that, as in hippocampus and neocortex, gamma-aminobutyric
	acid-A (GABAA)-mediated inhibition is generated in dendrites of pyramidal
	cells, not just in the somatic region as previously believed. This
	study examines selected properties of GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic
	currents (IPSCs) in dendritic and somatic regions that could provide
	insight into their functional roles. Pharmacologically isolated GABAA-mediated
	IPSCs were studied by whole cell patch recording in slices. To compare
	properties of IPSCs in distal dendritic and somatic regions, local
	stimulation was carried out with tungsten microelectrodes, and spatially
	restricted blockade of GABAA-mediated inhibition was achieved by
	pressure-ejection of bicuculline from micropipettes. The results
	revealed that largely independent circuits generate GABAA inhibition
	in distal apical dendritic and somatic regions. With such independence,
	a selective decrease in dendritic-region inhibition could enhance
	integrative or plastic processes in dendrites while allowing feedback
	inhibition in the somatic region to restrain system excitability.
	This could allow modulatory fiber systems from the basal forebrain
	or brain stem, for example, to change the functional state of the
	cortex by altering the excitability of interneurons that mediate
	dendritic inhibition without increasing the propensity for regenerative
	bursting in this highly epileptogenic system. As in hippocampus,
	GABAA-mediated IPSCs were found to have fast and slow components
	with time constants of decay on the order of 10 and 40 ms, respectively,
	at 29 degrees C. Modeling analysis supported physiological evidence
	that the slow time constant represents a true IPSC component rather
	than an artifactual slowing of the fast component from voltage clamp
	of a dendritic current. The results indicated that, whereas both
	dendritic and somatic-region IPSCs have both fast and slow GABAA
	components, there is a greater proportion of the slow component in
	dendrites. In a companion paper, the hypothesis is explored that
	the resulting slower time course of the dendritic IPSC increases
	its capacity to regulate the N-methyl--aspartate component of EPSPs.
	Finally, evidence is presented that the slow GABAA-mediated IPSC
	component is regulated by presynaptic GABAB inhibition whereas the
	fast is not. Based on the requirement for presynaptic GABAB-mediated
	block of inhibition for expression of long-term potentiation, this
	finding is consistent with participation of the slow GABAA component
	in regulation of synaptic plasticity. The lack of susceptibility
	of the fast GABAA component to the long-lasting, activity-induced
	suppression mediated by presynaptic GABAB receptors is consistent
	with a protective role for this process in preventing seizure activity.}

	It is a familiar experience that we tend to close our eyes or divert
	our gaze when concentrating attention on cognitively demanding tasks.
	We report on the brain activity correlates of directing attention
	away from potentially competing visual processing and toward processing
	in another sensory modality. Results are reported from a series of
	positron-emission tomography studies of the human brain engaged in
	somatosensory tasks, in both "eyes open" and "eyes closed" conditions.
	During these tasks, there was a significant decrease in the regional
	cerebral blood flow in the visual cortex, which occurred irrespective
	of whether subjects had to close their eyes or were instructed to
	keep their eyes open. These task-related deactivations of the association
	areas belonging to the nonrelevant sensory modality were interpreted
	as being due to decreased metabolic activity. Previous research has
	clearly demonstrated selective activation of cortical regions involved
	in attention-demanding modality-specific tasks; however, the other
	side of this story appears to be one of selective deactivation of
	unattended areas.}

	Olfactory bulb activity has been postulated to be chaotic, as measured
	in the EEG, and to be subject to an attractor with many "wings" enabling
	classification of different learned odor classes. Two parallel questions
	are thus addressed by the work presented here: (1) what is the evidence
	for attractors in the olfactory system, which can mediate learned
	odor classes? and (2) how does the olfactory system enter a specific
	attractor or attractor wing associated with the learned odor during
	the classification process? Both of these questions address the wider
	notion of endogenous activity preparing the system for an expected
	stimulus, which is at the basis of the reafference principle. By
	viewing the brain as a distributed complex dynamical system with
	global attractors, these questions can be answered together. Rats
	were implanted with bipolar macroelectrodes in the Olfactory Bulb
	(OB), Prepyriform Cortex (PPC), Entorhinal Cortex (EC), and Dentate
	Gyrus (DG), and then trained in an operant paradigm to press a bar
	for a reward in the presence of one odor and to receive no reward
	in the presence of another odor. Local Field Potentials (LFP) were
	recorded simultaneously from the structures during the operant task.
	We present evidence for three endogenous events: (1) preafference,
	which is manifested both by the EC entering an attractor and a mid-range
	signal (15-30 Hz) which appears to be passed from the EC to the OB
	just before the OB enters an attractor; (2) afference, where the
	OB enters an attractor during the odor recognition period of the
	experiment and the LFP recordings indicate that the OB drives the
	other structures in all frequency bands, especially the high gamma
	band (65-100 Hz) associated with the OB burst frequency; and (3)
	reafference or post-afference, which is accompanied by a lower frequency
	gamma band signal (40-60 Hz) originating in the PPC and passed to
	both the OB and the EC just before the onset of the motor response
	to the odor. We use a new method, NECTAR (Nonparametric Exact Contingency
	Table Association Routine), related to mutual information, to verify
	what is seen with coherence and phase estimates, the apparent driving
	of each structure at different times in the odor trials, and to display
	evidence for non-periodic attractors governing both individual physiological
	structures and the system of structures. This is the first evidence
	of an endogenous, limbic event associated with sensory perceptual
	tuning in a mammal. These results are also the first experimental
	confirmation that the attractors governing olfactory activity involve
	multiple sites in the olfactory/limbic system and implement the process

	fixation points. We measured eye movements of macaque monkeys freely
	viewing a set of natural and manipulated images outside a particular
	task. To probe the effect of scene content, we locally introduced
	patches of pink noise into natural images, and to probe the interaction
	with image structure, we altered the contrast of the noise. We found
	that fixations specifically targeted the natural image parts and
	spared the uninformative noise patches. However, both increasing
	and decreasing the contrast of the noise attracted more fixations,
	and, in the extreme cases, compensated the effect of missing content.
	Introducing patches from another natural image led to similar results.
	In all paradigms tested, the interaction between scene structure
	and informative scene content was the same in any of the first six
	fixations on an image, demonstrating that the weighting of these
	factors is constant during viewing of an image. These results question

	broad-band noise and tactile stimulation of hand and foot in anaesthetized

	side of the primary auditory cortex in the caudal auditory belt.
	Integration was stronger for temporally coincident stimuli and obeyed
	the principle of inverse effectiveness: greater enhancement for less

	of auditory saliency and predicts the detectability of salient sounds
	embedded in noisy backgrounds. In addition, it also predicts the
	natural orienting behavior of naive macaque monkeys to the same salient

	of successfully used visual saliency maps. Hence, we conclude that
	saliency is determined either by implementing similar mechanisms

  abstract = {In the simultaneous multitone masking paradigm introduced by Neff
	and Green [Percept. Psychophys. 41, 409-415 (1987)] the masker typically
	is a small number of tones having frequencies and levels that are
	randomly drawn on every presentation. Large amounts of masking for
	a pure-tone signal often occur that are thought to reflect central,
	rather than peripheral, limitations on processing. Previous work
	from this laboratory has indicated that playing a rapid succession
	of randomly drawn multitone maskers in each observation interval
	dramatically reduces the amount of masking that is observed relative
	to a single burst (SB). In this multiple-bursts-different (MBD) procedure,
	the signal tone is the only constant frequency component during the
	sequence of bursts and tends to perceptually segregate from the masker.
	In this study, the number of masker bursts and the interburst interval
	(IBI) were varied. The goals were to determine how the release from
	masking relative to the SB condition depends on the number of bursts
	and to examine whether increasing the IBI would cause each burst
	to be processed independently. If the latter were true, it might
	disrupt the perception of signal stream coherence, thereby diminishing
	the MBD advantage. However, multiple independent looks could also
	lead to an improvement in performance. For those subjects showing
	large amounts of informational masking in the SB condition, substantial
	reduction in masked thresholds occurred as the number of masker bursts
	increased, while masking increased as IBI lengthened. The results
	were not consistent with a simple version of a multiple-look model
	in which the information from each burst was combined optimally,
	but instead appear to be attributable to mechanisms involved in the
	perceptual organization of sounds.}

	could attract attention automatically. Participants viewed a display
	of nine red and green elements, one of which was the target, and
	had to identify the target's color. On some trials, a subset of the
	elements was grouped by Gestalt factors (collinearity, closure, and
	symmetry) into an object. The object was task-irrelevant and unpredictive
	of the target. Performance on trials with an object present in the
	display was faster than performance on trials with no object for
	targets in the object area (a benefit) but slower for targets in
	a nonobject area (a cost). These findings demonstrate that an object
	by itself can capture attention automatically in a stimulus-driven

	and gain in two populations of conductance-based, single-compartment
	model neurons. The first population consisted of 1000 model neurons
	with differing values of seven voltage-dependent conductances. In
	many of these models, increasing the sodium conductance threefold
	unexpectedly reduced the firing rate and divisively scaled the gain
	at high input current. In the second population, consisting of 1000
	simplified model neurons, we found that enhanced sodium conductance
	changed the frequency-current (FI) curve in two computationally distinct
	ways, depending on the firing rate. In these models, increased sodium
	conductance produced a subtractive shift in the FI curve at low firing
	rates because the additional sodium conductance allowed the neuron
	to respond more strongly to equivalent input current. In contrast,
	at high input current, the increase in sodium conductance resulted
	in a divisive change in the gain because the increased conductance
	produced a proportionally larger activation of the delayed rectifier
	potassium conductance. The control and sodium-enhanced FI curves
	intersect at a point that delimits two regions in which the same
	biophysical manipulation produces two fundamentally different changes
	to the model neuron's computational properties. This suggests a potentially
	difficult problem for homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability.},

	model for synaptic long-term plasticity that relies on the relative
	timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials. Being given an
	input statistics, we compute the stationary synaptic weights that
	result from the temporal correlations between the pre- and postsynaptic
	spikes. By means of both analytic calculations and computer simulations,
	we show that such a mechanism of synaptic plasticity is able to strengthen
	those input synapses that convey precisely timed spikes at the expense
	of synapses that deliver spikes with a broad temporal distribution.
	This may be of vital importance for any kind of information processing
	based on spiking neurons and temporal coding.},

	fire phase-locked to theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) or to sharp-wave-associated
	ripple oscillations (120-200 Hz), which represent different behavioural
	states. Interneurons also entrain pyramidal cells in vitro. The large
	diversity of interneurons poses the question of whether they have
	specific roles in shaping distinct network activities in vivo. Here
	we report that three distinct interneuron types--basket, axo-axonic
	and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare cells--visualized and defined by
	synaptic connectivity as well as by neurochemical markers, contribute
	differentially to theta and ripple oscillations in anaesthetized
	rats. The firing patterns of individual cells of the same class are
	remarkably stereotyped and provide unique signatures for each class.
	We conclude that the diversity of interneurons, innervating distinct

	subdivide the surface of pyramidal cells and act in discrete time

  abstract = {Neighboring cells in topographical sensory maps may transmit similar
	information to the next higher level of processing. How information
	transmission by groups of nearby neurons compares with the performance
	of single cells is a very important question for understanding the
	functioning of the nervous system. To tackle this problem, we quantified
	stimulus-encoding and feature extraction performance by pairs of
	simultaneously recorded electrosensory pyramidal cells in the hindbrain
	of weakly electric fish. These cells constitute the output neurons
	of the first central nervous stage of electrosensory processing.
	Using random amplitude modulations (RAMs) of a mimic of the fish's
	own electric field within behaviorally relevant frequency bands,
	we found that pyramidal cells with overlapping receptive fields exhibit
	strong stimulus-induced correlations. To quantify the encoding of
	the RAM time course, we estimated the stimuli from simultaneously
	recorded spike trains and found significant improvements over single
	spike trains. The quality of stimulus reconstruction, however, was
	still inferior to the one measured for single primary sensory afferents.
	In an analysis of feature extraction, we found that spikes of pyramidal
	cell pairs coinciding within a time window of a few milliseconds
	performed significantly better at detecting upstrokes and downstrokes
	of the stimulus compared with isolated spikes and even spike bursts
	of single cells. Coincident spikes can thus be considered 'distributed
	bursts.' Our results suggest that stimulus encoding by primary sensory
	afferents is transformed into feature extraction at the next processing
	stage. There, stimulus-induced coincident activity can improve the
	extraction of behaviorally relevant features from the stimulus.}

  abstract = {Coincidence detection at the nucleus laminaris (NL) of a chicken was
	improved between embryos (embryonic days (E) 16 and 17) and chicks
	(post-hatch days (P) 2-7) in slice preparations. Electrical stimuli
	were applied bilaterally to the projection fibres to the NL at various
	intervals. The response window corresponding to the temporal separation
	of electrical stimuli that resulted in half-maximal firing probability
	was adopted as the measure of coincidence detection, and was narrower
	in chicks (1.4 ms) than in embryos (3.9 ms). Between these two ages,
	the membrane time constant of NL neurons was reduced from 18.4 to
	3.2 ms and the membrane conductance was increased 5-fold, while no
	difference was measured in the input capacitance. Evoked EPSCs decayed
	slightly faster in chicks, while the size and the time course of
	miniature EPSCs were unchanged. Action potentials had lower thresholds
	and larger after-hyperpolarization in chicks than in embryos. Dendrotoxin-I
	depolarized cells and increased their input resistance significantly
	at both ages, eliminated the after-hyperpolarization, and delayed
	the decay phase of action potentials, indicative of the expression
	of low-threshold K(+) channels. Cs(+) hyperpolarized the cells, increased
	the input resistance and eliminated sags during hyperpolarization
	at both ages, while the hyperpolarization sag was affected by neither
	Ba(2+) nor TEA. These data indicate the expression of hyperpolarization-activated
	cation channels. Between these two ages, the maximum conductance
	of low-threshold K(+) channels increased 4-fold to about 16 nS, and
	hyperpolarization-activated channels increased 6-fold to about 10
	nS. Improvement of coincidence detection correlated with the acceleration
	of the EPSP time course as a result of the increase of these conductances.}

	detectors. They try to refute Shadlen and Newsome by saying that
	not so many synaptic potentials are coming in at each neuron as S+N
	assumed and that, furthermore, the low reliability of synapses makes
	the number of synaptic events going thru to the postsynaptic neuron
	even smaller. So, therefore, they argue, the argument of S+N is wrong
	because it assumes that the 'amplitude' (I presume they mean frequency)
	of the input and output of the neuron is the same, and this is not
	true. I must admit I do not really understand this argumentation.
	They also attack the balanced inhibition hypothesis. They argue that
	inhibition is usually broader tuned than excitation and that therefore,
	even if excit. and inh. happened to be exactly balanced for one particular
	stimulus, this would change if a second stimulus would be added or
	if the stimulus itself would change. Likewise, the observed oscillations
	correspond to alternating inhibition and excitation. They argue,

	observed. }

  abstract = {Sensory information processing in neocortex is associated with rhythmic
	synchronized gamma frequency firing of sensory cortical units and
	similar frequency oscillations of the field potentials. Different
	aspects of the gamma activity (20?80 Hz) have been suggested as correlates
	of attention, arousal and sensory binding. It is clear that attention
	has a modality selective influence, while arousal has a more general
	effect on the sensory systems. We used an experimental conditioning
	paradigm to separate these differential effects of attention and
	arousal on spontaneous neocortical gamma activity. We recorded field
	potentials with epidural electrodes placed above the auditory cortical
	areas of cats. The animals performed a simple instrumental alimentary
	conditioning task with different modality (visual and auditory) conditioned
	stimuli. When they attended to the auditory conditioned stimulus,
	both frequency and power increase of spontaneous gamma activity were
	detected. However when they attended visual, we found no power increase
	of gamma activity recorded above auditory areas, while the frequency
	increase was the same as in the "attend auditory" condition. We conclude
	that the power modulation of gamma activity is modality specific
	and thus can be attributed to selective attention, whereas the frequency
	modulation of gamma activity shows no modality specificity, it is
	influenced by the arousal level.}

	control program or schema for a particular action must include directions
	for the oculomotor and visual processing systems. In many activities
	(reading text and music, typing, steering) processed information
	is held in a memory buffer for a period of about a second. This permits
	a match between the discontinuous input from the eyes and continuous
	motor output, and in particular allows the eyes to be involved in
	more than one task.}

	thought to arise from the coherent and rhythmic activity of large
	numbers of neurons, were observed first in the olfactory system and
	have since been described in many neocortical areas. The importance
	of these oscillations in information coding, however, is controversial.
	Here, local field potential and intracellular recordings were obtained
	from the antennal lobe and mushroom body of the locust Schistocerca
	americana. Different odors evoked coherent oscillations in different,
	but usually overlapping, ensembles of neurons. The phase of firing
	of individual neurons relative to the population was not dependent
	on the odor. The components of a coherently oscillating ensemble
	of neurons changed over the duration of a single exposure to an odor.
	It is thus proposed that odors are encoded by specific but dynamic
	assemblies of coherently oscillating neurons. Such distributed and
	temporal representation of complex sensory signals may facilitate
	combinatorial coding and associative learning in these, and possibly
	other, sensory networks.},

	brain (the functional analog of mitral-tufted cells in the vertebrate
	olfactory bulb) lo natural blends and simple odors were studied with
	multiple intra- and extracellular recordings in vivo. Individual
	odors evoked complex temporal response patterns in many neurons.
	These patterns differed across odors for a given neuron and across
	neurons for a given odor, but were stable for each neuron over repealed
	presentations (separated by seconds to minutes) of the same odor.
	The response of individual neurons to an odor was superimposed on
	an odors specific coherent oscillatory population activity. Each
	neuron usually participated in the coherent oscillations during one
	or more specific epochs of the ensemble activity. These epochs of
	phase locking were reliable for each neuron over tens of repeated
	presentations of one odor. The timing of these epochs of synchronization
	differed across neurons and odors. Correlated activity of specific
	pairs of neurons, hence, generally occurred transiently during the
	population response, at times that were specific to these pairs and
	to the odor smelled. The field potential oscillations, therefore,
	fail to reveal a progressive transformation of the synchronized ensemble
	as the response to the odor unfolds. We propose that (1) odors are
	represented by spatially and temporally distributed ensembles of
	coherently firing neurons, and (2) the field potential oscillations
	that characterize odor responses in the olfactory system occur, at
	least in this animal, in parallel with a slower dynamic odor representation.},

  abstract = {1. Primary somatosensory cortical (SI) neurons exhibit characteristic
	activity before the initiation of movements. This premovement activity
	(PMA) may result from centrally generated as well as from peripheral
	inputs. We examined PMA for 55 SI neurons (10, 13, 28, and 4 in areas
	3a, 3b, 1, and 2, respectively) with activity that was entrained
	to vibrotactile stimulation (i.e., was temporally correlated with
	the stimulus). We sought to determine whether the temporal characteristics
	of vibration-entrained discharges would change throughout the reaction
	time period, and, if they did, whether these changes might be accounted
	for by central inputs. 2. Monkeys made wrist flexions and extensions
	in response to sinusoidal vibration (27, 57, or 127 Hz) of their
	palms. Vibration remained on until the animal moved at least 5 degrees
	from the initial hold position. Mean firing rate (MFR), a measure
	of the level of activity, was derived from the number of spikes per
	vibratory cycle. The correlation between the vibration and the neuronal
	firing was described by the mean phase (MP) of the vibratory cycle
	at which spikes occurred. The degree of entrainment was quantified
	as synchronicity (Synch), a statistical parameter that could change
	from 0 for no entrainment to 1 for responses at a constant phase.
	3. Premovement MFR increases (activation) and decreases (suppression)
	were observed. Moreover, two changes in MFR often were observed for
	the same neuron (2-event PMA). Many MFR shifts, especially the first
	in the two-event PMA, preceded electromyographic (EMG) onset. The
	pre-EMG MFR shifts more often had the same sign both for flexion
	and extension movements rather than having opposite signs. However,
	with equal frequency, post-EMG PMA events had the same or opposite
	sign for different movement directions. We suggest that the pre-EMG
	PMA has an origin different from movement-related peripheral reafference.
	4. Premovement activation was accompanied by shifts of MP corresponding
	to earlier responses to the ongoing vibratory stimulus and by decreases
	of response Synch. Premovement suppression was not associated with
	consistent shifts of MP and Synch. We suggest that during premovement
	activation, asynchronous (uncorrelated with vibration) signals are
	integrated with the vibratory input. These asynchronous signals may
	make neurons more likely to discharge and to do so earlier with respect
	to the vibratory stimulus. The asynchronous component may also disrupt
	the vibration-entrained activity pattern.},

	Much of the progress has come from studies of fear, and especially
	fear conditioning. This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important
	component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and
	expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli
	enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also
	been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms
	that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown
	that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain.
	It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where
	past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined
	aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such
	as "affect," "hedonic tone," or "emotional feelings," and used a
	simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research
	being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes
	of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this

	mechanisms underlying afferent adaptation. Here we describe the time-course
	of afferent adaptation and recovery. We found that absolute and entrainment
	thresholds rise and fall exponentially during adaptation and recovery

	I (SA1) afferents adapt most rapidly, and pacinian (PC) afferents
	adapt most slowly, whereas rapidly adapting (RA) afferents exhibit
	intermediate rates of adaptation; SA1 fibers also recover more rapidly
	from adaptation than RA and PC fibers. We also showed that threshold
	adaptation is accompanied by a shift in the timing of the spikes
	within individual cycles of the adapting stimulus (i.e., a shift
	in the impulse phase). We invoked an integrate-and-fire model to
	explore possible mechanisms underlying afferent adaptation. Finally,
	we found that the time-course of afferent adaptation is more rapid

	of recovery from adaptation, suggesting that central factors play

  abstract = {Peripheral vision is characterized by reduced spatial resolution and
	inhibitory spatial interactions that extend over long distances.
	This work had three goals. (1) We considered whether the extensive
	crowding in peripheral vision is a consequence of a shift in the
	spatial scale of analysis. To test this, using a large range of target
	sizes and spatial frequencies, we measured the extent of crowding
	for targets that were limited in their spatial frequency content.
	(2) We considered whether crowding in peripheral vision can be explained
	on the basis of contrast masking by remote flanks. To test this hypothesis,
	we measured and compared crowding in a direction-identification experiment
	with masking by remote flanks in a detection experiment. In each
	of the experiments, our targets and flanks were composed of Gabor
	features, thus allowing us to control the feature contrast, spatial
	frequency, and orientation. (3) We examined the relationship between
	the suppressive and facilitatory interactions in peripheral contrast
	detection and crowding. Our results show that unlike the normal fovea
	(Levi, Klein, & Hariharan, 2002), peripheral crowding is not scale
	invariant nor is it attributable to simple contrast masking. Rather,
	our results suggest that inhibitory spatial interactions in peripheral
	crowding extend over larger distances than in the fovea for targets
	of the same size. In peripheral vision, the critical distance for
	crowding is approximately 0.1 times the target eccentricity. Observers
	can easily detect the features that compose our targets (Gabor patches)
	under conditions where crowding is strong. Thus, we speculate that
	peripheral crowding occurs because the target and flanks are combined
	or pooled at a second stage, following the stage of feature extraction.
	In peripheral vision, this pooling takes place over a large distance.}

  abstract = {We examined the distribution of pulvinar afferents to visual area
	V2 of macaque monkey cerebral cortex in relation to the distribution
	of the metabolic enzyme cytochrome oxidase (GO). V2 contains three
	sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining
	for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The
	pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input
	is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern
	of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike
	compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP
	into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions)
	and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell
	label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower
	layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well;
	terminal label in layers 3-4 was distributed in discrete patches
	with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent
	sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal
	zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and
	targeted both ''thick'' (Cat-301(+)) and ''thin'' GO-rich stripes,
	avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of
	terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers
	5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer
	6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises
	primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO
	staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the
	presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot
	rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons
	project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent
	thalamic input shared by the ''thick'' and ''thin'' CO stripes (which
	receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections
	to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic
	interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests
	another potential source of integration between the two cortical
	visual streams.},

	local field potentials (LFPs) from surface-to-depth bipolar electrodes
	at six sites in the ventral region of the right hemisphere visual
	cortex in a highly trained macaque monkey during performance of a
	visual pattern discrimination task. Applying a new statistical measure,
	the short-time directed transfer function (STDTF), to the LFP data
	set, we charted the changing strength and direction of causal influence
	between these cortical sites on a fraction-of-a-second time scale.
	We present results showing, for the first time, the dynamics of distinct
	feedforward, feedback and lateral influences in the ventral portion
	of the primate visual cortex during visual pattern processing.}

	on which they are measured. However, in many physical systems, a
	property, L, depends on the scale, ϵ, at which it is measured such
	that L(ϵ)∝ϵ1−D where D is the fractal dimension. Such systems are
	said to be ‘fractal’. Based on the assumption that the kinetic rates
	are given by k(t)∝t1−D we derive a fractalmodel of ion-channel kinetics.
	This fractalmodel has fewer adjustable parameters, is more consistent
	with the dynamics of protein conformations, and fits the single-channel
	recordings from the corneal endothelium better than the discrete-state
	Markov model.},

  abstract = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms
	that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric
	ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent pathways are
	used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in
	an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type,
	the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical
	activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent
	membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting on different
	time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given
	range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane
	currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity
	approximately 90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern
	of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances,
	and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral
	pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model
	neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the
	original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the
	activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period,
	but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The
	model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain
	fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal
	conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems
	capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number
	of different time scales.},

  abstract = {Figures that can be seen in more than one way are invaluable tools
	for the study of the neural basis of visual awareness, because such
	stimuli permit the dissociation of the neural responses that underlie
	what we perceive at any given time from those forming the sensory
	representation of a visual pattern. To study the former type of responses,
	monkeys were subjected to binocular rivalry, and the response of
	neurons in a number of different visual areas was studied while the
	animals reported their alternating percepts by pulling levers. Perception-related
	modulations of neural activity were found to occur to different extents
	in different cortical visual areas. The cells that were affected
	by suppression were almost exclusively binocular, and their proportion
	was found to increase in the higher processing stages of the visual
	system. The strongest correlations between neural activity and perception
	were observed in the visual areas of the temporal lobe. A strikingly
	large number of neurons in the early visual areas remained active
	during the perceptual suppression of the stimulus, a finding suggesting
	that conscious visual perception might be mediated by only a subset
	of the cells exhibiting stimulus selective responses. These physiological
	findings, together with a number of recent psychophysical studies,
	offer a new explanation of the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Indeed,
	rivalry has long been considered to be closely linked with binocular
	fusion and stereopsis, and the sequences of dominance and suppression
	have been viewed as the result of competition between the two monocular
	channels. The physiological data presented here are incompatible
	with this interpretation. Rather than reflecting interocular competition,
	the rivalry is most probably between the two different central neural
	representations generated by the dichoptically presented stimuli.
	The mechanisms of rivalry are probably the same as, or very similar
	to, those underlying multistable perception in general, and further
	physiological studies might reveal much about the neural mechanisms
	of our perceptual organization. },

	cell), rapidly adapting (RA, Meissner) and Pacinian corpuscle (PC)
	mechanoreceptors were analyzed as a function of the instantaneous
	position, velocity, and acceleration of a dynamic stimulus. For these
	experiments, a vibrotactile punctate stimulator was driven by a non-repeating-noise
	sequence. The resulting data (sampled stimulus waveform, windowed
	impulse) were processed in several ways. Initially, input-output
	correlation analysis was implemented to generate spike-aligned averages
	of the stimulus waveform preceding and following impulse initiation.
	From this analysis, it was determined that dual-responding RA and
	PC afferents--that is, those afferents that responded to both indenting
	and extracting stimulus movements--universally responded in a nearly
	perfectly symmetrical manner to the stimulus. Subsequently, two-dimensional
	(position, velocity) state histograms were generated and used to
	assess mechanoreceptor dynamic stimulus sensitivities. From these
	state histograms, it was determined that the threshold for impulse
	initiation by SAI afferents was preferentially sensitive to the indentation
	position of the stimulus, with only a minor sensitivity to stimulus
	velocity. RA afferent thresholds were sensitive to a continuum of
	dynamic stimulus velocities and positions. At the extremes, RA afferent
	impulses could be initiated by either a highly indented, low-velocity
	stimulus or high-velocity stimulus with a limited indentation position.
	PC afferents appeared to be preferentially sensitive to a combination
	of stimulus velocity and acceleration, but the data-sampling interval
	was too coarse to adequately resolve the full range of dynamic stimulus
	sensitivities.},

	explored raised line drawings using the distal pad of the index finger
	or the distal pads both of the index and of the middle fingers. In
	the visual condition, a computer-driven display was used to simulate
	tactual exploration. By moving an electronic pen over a digitizing
	tablet, the subject could explore a line drawing stored in memory;
	on the display screen a portion of the drawing appeared to move behind
	a stationary aperture, in concert with the movement of the pen. This
	aperture was varied in width, thus simulating the use of one or two
	fingers. In terms of average recognition accuracy and average response
	latency, recognition performance was virtually the same in the one-finger
	touch condition and the simulated one-finger vision condition. Visual
	recognition performance improved considerably when the visual field
	size was doubled (simulating two fingers), but tactual performance
	showed little improvement, suggesting that the effective tactual
	field of view for this task is approximately equal to one finger
	pad. This latter result agrees with other reports in the literature
	indicating that integration of two-dimensional pattern information
	extending over multiple fingers on the same hand is quite poor. The
	near equivalence of tactual picture perception and narrow-field vision
	suggests that the difficulties of tactual picture recognition must
	be largely due to the narrowness of the effective field of view.}

	Fractal gating characteristics changed the form of the interspike

	as a collection of ion channels with either quasifractal or Markov

	is sufficient to account for fractal-rate firing behavior.},

	stimulus yields RGC and LGN driven spike trains similar in character
	to those observed in the maintained discharge, with two notable distinctions:
	action potentials are reorganized along the time axis so that they
	occur only during certain phases of the stimulus waveform, and fractal
	activity is suppressed. Under both uniform-luminance and drifting-grating
	stimulus conditions (but not in the dark), the discharges of pairs

	discharges of RGCs are nearly uncorrelated with each other. This

	Poisson point process (FSNDP), for which the associated impulse response
	functions assume a decaying power-law form. For a variety of parameters
	of the process, we obtain expressions for the count-number distribution
	and moments, Fano factor, normalized coincidence rate, power spectral
	density, and time probability densities. A number of these measures
	exhibit power-law dependencies, indicating fractal behavior. For
	certain parameters the power spectral density exhibits 1/f-type behavior
	over a substantial range of frequencies, so that the process serves
	as a 1/f-alpha point process for alpha in the range 0 < alpha < 2.
	We consider two physical processes that are well described by the
	FSNDP: Cherenkov radiation from a random stream of charged particles,
	and diffusion of randomly injected concentration packets.},

  abstract = { A fully connected network of spiking neurons modeling motor cortical
	directional operations is presented and analyzed. The model allows
	for the basic biological requirements stemming from the results of
	experimental studies. The dynamical evolution of the network's output
	is interpreted as the sequential generation of neuronal population
	vectors representing the combined directional tendency of the ensemble.
	Adding these population vectors tip-to-tail yields the neural-vector
	trajectory that describes the upcoming movement trajectory. The key
	point of the model is that the intra-network interactions provide
	sustained dynamics, whereas external inputs are only required to
	initiate the population. The network is trained to generate neural-vector
	trajectories corresponding to basic types of two-dimensional movements
	(the network with specified connections can store one trajectory).
	A simple modification of the simulated annealing algorithm enables
	training of the network in the presence of noise. Training in the
	presence of noise yield's robustness of the learned dynamical behaviors.
	Another key point of the model is that the directional preference
	of a single neuron is determined by the synaptic connections. Accordingly,
	individual preferred directions as well as tuning curves are not
	assigned, but emerge as the result of interactions inside the population.
	For trained networks, the spiking behavior of single neurons and
	correlations between different neurons as well as the global activity
	of the population are discussed in the light of experimental findings.},

	changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG)
	on three time scales: (1) during minute-scale and longer periods
	of intermittent responding, mean activity levels in the (< 4 Hz)
	delta and (4-6 Hz) theta bands, and at the sleep spindle frequency
	(14 Hz) are higher than during alert performance. (2) In most subjects,
	4-6 Hz theta EEG activity begins to increase, and gamma band activity
	above 35 Hz begins to decrease, about 10 s before presentations of
	undetected targets, while before detected targets, 4-6 Hz amplitude
	decreases and gamma band amplitude increases. Both these amplitude
	differences last 15-20 s and occur in parallel with event-related
	cycles in target detection probability. In the same periods, alpha
	and sleep-spindle frequency amplitudes also show prominent 15-20
	s cycles, but these are not phase locked to performance cycles. (3)
	A second or longer after undetected targets, amplitude at intermediate
	(10-25 Hz) frequencies decreases briefly, while detected targets
	are followed by a transient amplitude increase in the same latency
	and frequency range.}

	capacity-limited stages are necessary for the conscious report of
	the stimuli. Here we used the attentional blink paradigm and fMRI
	to neurally distinguish these two stages of vision. Subjects detected
	a face target and a scene target presented rapidly among distractors
	at fixation. Although the second, scene target frequently went undetected
	by the subjects, it nonetheless activated regions of the medial temporal
	cortex involved in high-level scene representations, the parahippocampal
	place area (PPA). This PPA activation was amplified when the stimulus
	was consciously perceived. By contrast, the frontal cortex was activated
	only when scenes were successfully reported. These results suggest
	that medial temporal cortex permits rapid categorization of the visual
	input, while the frontal cortex is part of a capacity-limited attentional
	bottleneck to conscious report.},

  pages = {2},
  abstract = {Adaptation of activity in excitable membranes occurs over a wide range
	of timescales. Standard computational approaches handle this wide
	temporal range in terms of multiple states and related reaction rates
	emanating from the complexity of ionic channels. The study described
	here takes a different (perhaps complementary) approach, by interpreting
	ion channel kinetics in terms of population dynamics. I show that
	adaptation in excitable membranes is reducible to a simple Logistic-like
	equation in which the essential non-linearity is replaced by a feedback
	loop between the history of activation and an adaptive transition
	rate that is sensitive to a single dimension of the space of inactive
	states. This physiologically measurable dimension contributes to

	La Jolla 92093-0608, USA. We investigated the cortical mechanisms
	of visual-spatial attention while subjects discriminated patterned
	targets within distractor arrays. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) was used to map the boundaries of retinotopic visual areas
	and to localize attention-related changes in neural activity within
	several of those areas, including primary visual (striate) cortex.
	Event-related potentials (ERPs) and modeling of their neural sources,
	however, indicated that the initial sensory input to striate cortex
	at 50-55 milliseconds after the stimulus was not modulated by attention.
	The earliest facilitation of attended signals was observed in extrastriate
	visual areas, at 70-75 milliseconds. We hypothesize that the striate
	cortex modulation found with fMRI may represent a delayed, re-entrant
	feedback from higher visual areas or a sustained biasing of striate
	cortical neurons during attention. ERP recordings provide critical
	temporal information for analyzing the functional neuroanatomy of
	visual attention.}
